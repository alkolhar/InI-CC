This all-Spanish handbook for parents with new babies will prove essential for any concerned about a child's health. Manual Pediatrico appeared first in English; the Spanish edition provides essential health information at a glance for parents unversed in medical care; and should be a mainstay of  any Spanish-speaking home with children

McCarthy's writing and portrayal of Lester Ballard, a necrophiliac, is so well done that when the townfolk are after him you want him to escape. And then you have to wonder...why am I siding with a necrophiliac of all people? The writing is up to the high standards expected of McCarthy, and as usual he plumbs darker side of the human psyche. The book has an interesting twist to the plot - Ballard is falsely accused of rape, his house is auctioned off and he's left as a social outcast, an animal. He is removed of all his ties to humanity and so becomes the animal. If you like books that deal with the darker side of life then give this a read

Do you giggle uncontrollably when poking corpses with a stick? If so, look no further, this book is for you.

I understand a book like this will appeal to a certain demographic. I guess I shouldn't have expected much, and I certainly didn't expect a literary masterpeice, but this was the first book in awhile I just felt like giving up on. I didn't, since it's so short, but I may just as well have. It is not that the book is so "grotesque" or "disturbing" as seen described elsewhere. The author either left out or was incapable of the proper narrative to make the potentially disturbing scenes at all vivid. Unfortunately, that applies to all aspects of this book.

The entire book is in rural vernacular, including ignoring proper punctuation. But the end result is that nothing is described in any detail. It's like reading a poorly worded list of stuff that happened. It's almost as if he wasn't really trying very hard, or as if the story really was told by a simpleminded country person - an omniscient one that can read people's minds. I suppose the idea could have worked, but doesn't. Not a terrible read, just annoying and vague. With so many other good books out there, why waste your time

I was initiated into the world of Cormac McCarthy with this novel in Southern Lit class.  My professor was the vice president of the Cormac McCarthy Appreciation Society and considers McCarthy one the most talented novelists of the twentieth century, as do I.  This work is very much a product of an evolved understanding of Faulkner.  It incorporates all of the typical faulknarian literary elements and subject matter, but stretches and evolves them to an unusually intense point.  There is a message about decay, especially of the south in the diction, especially where the flood and the degeneration of Lester Ballard are concerned.  There is Old South v. New South and the post reconstuction circumstances of the south with the disposession of Ballard.  There is also lust here, something that Faulkner tackeled in a more subtle manner than McCarthy in the Sound and the Fury and As I Lay Dying.  However, McCarthy's story of lust is intense and grotesque and is described without sentiment in an amazing display of the gift of total candor.  McCarthy is nothing short of stoic in his descriptions and must posess an amazing constitution, as he has the ability to write what would make most of us vomit just thinking about.  The ability to reduce a human character to the lowest common denomimnator, performing unspeakable acts of depravity and at the same time remaining a valid character whose presence still carries a literary message and a human one as well, is the most unique of gifts.  This novel may be hard to take for the faint of heart, but it is well worth the read.  It is haunting to the reader, not for its perverse subject matter, but for its understated messages, masterfully placed in the character of Lester Ballard, a disposessed and depraved madman, holding the dark secrets of what humanity can be driven to

I cannot speak to the literary points in the novel though I can say I enjoyed it. In fact, I couldn't put it down until I finished it. However, I think it an interesting setting considering it is set in my hometown of Sevierville, Tennessee! Strangely, the author refers accurately to several persons and events that I've known forever. Mr. Wade's children still live in Sevierville, so do the Whaley and Ogle families. The 1964 flood was over the parking meters and the White Caps were stopped by a real life Clint Eastwood of a Sevier County Sheriff! The opening scene with the auctioner can be based on no other than C.B. McCarter whose trademark saying was &amp;quot;WE SELL THE EARTH.&amp;quot; C.B., my grandfather, has never told me of any run-ins with Lester Ballard, the novels main character! THANK GOODNESS! As it turns out Ballard is a murdering necrophiliac. This is where McCarthy takes over and writes his story instead of mirroring persons of the actual community

There is no denying the strain of Faulkner that runs through McCarthy's early works; like his predecessor, McCarthy is concerned less with plot than with character and the many and sundry ways in which character and place (here, the hills of Eastern Tennessee) interact.  But McCarthy is more fun to read; his prose is lean and lyric and leaves lasting images in the mind's eye.  He does not shrink from displaying humanity in all its ugly (often ungodly) forms.  &amp;quot;Child of God&amp;quot; is best-known for its haunting portrayal of necrophilia--few writers could address so ghastly an act in such beautiful, elegant prose.  But that is one of the great joys of Cormac McCarthy's early novels--they are not so much tours de force as they are exhibitions of  beautifully painted landscape and haunting, nightmarish imagery

I have read sevral of McCarthy's other novels. His best ones stretch something to the limit.  In &amp;lt;Blood Meridian&amp;gt; it was violence.  Here it is simple depravity and lack of concern for other human beings.  Lester Ballard is the ultimate user.  Other people exist for him only to meet his needs, even if they are dead.  I have never before read a book about necrophilia, and yes, as many of the other reviewers point out, reading this book takes a strong stomach.  Yet McCarthy achieves something only the greatest writers can pull off, which is making an unsympathetic character sympathetic.  Totally in spite of myself, I found myself cheering Ballard on when he outwits the lynch mob and gets away.  The only thing I can imagine more outrageous than this book is a sympathetic portrayal of a child molester.  Yet, I believe that this is ultimately a spiritual book.  I don't think the title is meant to be ironic.  I think we are meant to see that even Lester Ballard really is a child of God

This is a gripping novel that probes the breadth of human depravity and perversity while plunging the reader into a malevolent and sinister world. Lester Ballard is a deeply deranged and demented individual with sexually perverse lusts that resides in the Eastern Tennessee countryside. He's accused of rape, imprisoned for a short time, then released after which he commits unspeakable acts against his fellow man. It's doubtful his incarceration had anything to do with his behavior since it's obvious from the start this man is troubled. This is a wonderful novel filled with effective imagery and stunning descriptiveness. I found the chapter where the town sheriff, deputy and old Mr. Wade rowing the boat through the flooded town streets to be quite interesting. A recommended book, but beware the subject matter is quite graphic and might not be suitable for those without strong stomachs

If you're considering buying the Peter Smith "edition" of this book, note that it is NOT a new "edition" in hardcover but the Vintage International edition rebound in red cloth, with the cover of said trade paperback glued onto the front. It looks like it's been rebound for libraries, is the type of thing that's usually not for sale to the general public (. . .) The book is WELL-REBOUND, and may still be worth it to you Cormac McCarthy diehards out there -- it is for me, and ultimately I'm just gonna keep the copy of it I bought, but it's still quite disappointing. Thought you deserved a warning, hope it came in time. McCarthy's a great writer, of course -- feel a little guilty about the one-star, but it's an issue of the edition, not the book

What I didn't realise when I ordered this is that it is an publication of a US kennel association.  It is a slim book, gives a good, realistic overview of kenneling from a management perspective, and is a good thing to read if you need to decide basic questions like &amp;quot;is the kennel business for me?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;what are the main issues in kennel management?&amp;quot;  Its orientation is toward large kennels (65+ dogs) in the US.  For someone like me, who is thinking about a small kennel in Australia, it was interesting, but not really worth its pricetag

"Ha ha ha hah ha hah!"  That's Stirling laughing all the way to the bank.  Or at least I hope that's what he is doing.  But sadly I suspect he more likely feels his Wiccan/SCA/DnD-infused vision of a post-apocalyptic society is a reasonable, nay, likely path we'll follow should selective physical laws break down.  Quick!  Stop me!  I feel the need to wave my sword, sing a Gaelic song, and break out my cauldron!  The genre requires we make a leap of faith.  And as a fan of the genre, I do so willingly.  But having made the leap, it is annoying at best to be forced through this "Tolkein as faith" drivel.  But as I will likely read the entire series (remember, I love the genre) I have to hope that Stirling leans towards the "thanks for the buck buddy" and is himself laughing at us all.  But a picture is worth a thousand words and his mug on the inside cover tells me he believes this nonsense!

My recommendation?  Read the book.  Laugh a bit.  Maybe laugh a lot. But do this with the library's copy, not one you paid for

The Protector's War (2005) is the second Alternate History novel in the Change series, following Dies the Fire.  In the previous volume, the Bearkillers allied with the Mackenzie Clan, CORA -- Central Oregon Ranchers' Association -- and the University Committee.  They cooperated in assaults on the fortifications along Highway 20 at the Echo Creek bridge, using Larson's trebucket against the eastern fort as a distraction.  Then they attacked the western fort from the sky with hang-gliders.

In this novel, during the eighth year after the Change, Alleyne Loring and John Hordle break into Woburn Abbey to free Nigel and Maude Loring.  The Special Icelander Detachment guards are bypassed, distracted or taken out while the rescue party pulls out the window bars and climbs up to the Lorings.  Nigel and Maude barricade the door and arm themselves with makeshift weapons.

When the blocked door is noticed, Nigel and Maude respond with knife and club as the SID guards attempt to force the door.  They gain some time, but eventually the guards get into the room.  Nigel finally gets a sword and fends off his attackers.  When Hordle enters the room, the guards retreat down the hallway.

Nigel has minor wounds, but Maude has been cut through the abdomen.  She bleeds out as her husband holds her.  At the urgings of the rescuers, Nigel lays Maude's body on the sofa and flees out the window.  The SID guards don't pursue them, but other troops are searching the countryside.

At Larsdalen, on the ninth anniversary of the Change, Mike Havel -- Lord Bear -- concludes the three day meeting with the ceremonial lighting of a pile of gunpowder;  as it burns instead of flaring, the audience cheers, moans or otherwise signifies their acceptance of another year of the Change. The party (or wake) continues with a pancake breakfast and the ritual of acceptance of graduated military apprentices into the A-list.

Lord Ken, Mike's father-in-law, shows his latest attempts to understand the Change.  The Ideal Gas Law has been modified to restrict the pressure within a gas beyond a certain threshold to less than the former value;  the gas seems to gain mass instead of pressure.  Still, reduction in pressure results in the same loss of heat as before the Change.  It looks like the Alien Space Bat theory is correct;  someone or something has imposed the Change upon them.

In McMinnville, the Protector is building another fort.  This one is a full fledged castle with plenty of steel I-beams and concrete.  Still, the Protector is not assembling his men for an immediate attack.

This story is, despite the name, the prelude to the Protector's War.  Both sides are preparing for the war, but not eager to start it right away.  The Protectorate is stronger, but the alliance is growing faster.  Of course, the alliance has the usual weaknesses of a democracy:  self-centered concerns, diverse opinions, and sheer indecisiveness.  All this hampers their preparations, but few really doubt that the Protectorate will try to conquer the Williamette Valley and beyond.

BTW, do you reckon that the date of the Change -- March 17th -- is symbolic?  It is Saint Patrick's Day and Juney's mother was Irish, but what could it mean?

Highly recommended for Stirling fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of political intrigue, military training and actions, and perseverance.

I loved Stirling's "Islands in the Sea of Time" trilogy, and I also loved the first book in this series.  Stirling is one of the best alternative history writers in the business, in my mind head and shoulders above Turtledove and Flint in his prose and his execution, but this book is one of the first books I've ever read in which ALMOST NOTHING HAPPENS AT ALL.  It is not true to your reader to use an entire book, which runs seven dollars for a paperback, to set up the third book but which does so little to advance the plot or the characters.  This book is a major disappointment.  Also, I found myself wincing, even in the first book, at the emphasis on witchcraft with the main characters.  It comes across as simply ludicrous.  The best scenes in this book are the ones involving the escape from Britain of the tangential British characters.  This is a very poor effort and though I plan to read book three even though I hated book two, I think a person, by reading the reviews of book two on Amazon, could skip the book entirely and read book three without missing a thing

It completely sucked. Very long with nothing to say. Author was proud of his own knowledge of the SCA and Wiccans, and the publishers thought that obviated the need for plot or character development. What's the worst is that the extra length is just packed full of both cliched lines and characters.

I now live overseas, so I bought a bunch of books in the "4 for 3" price discount section in order to save money. This is the first one I read of the received books. If they're all this bad, I'll be avoiding that discount database in the future

I found that everytime I started getting to like the story it would stop or change subjects or switch gears without finishing the smaller plot or finish the plot very unsatisfactory. For instance the family that was running from the Baron and his men, it started out fine and then of course the rest of the Wiccan Army shows up and it ends. Some mumbo voodoo curse and the bad guy runs away. No one bothered to help the family or find out why they were running they were just forgotten. Well later they are caught stealing sheep but the point is there was no conclusion to the scene when it ended I was like "what just happened!". It misses the small points that make a world believable, most humans would have talked to the family and would offer them food or something or at the very least say the scouts could not find them. There was no humanity in the scene (which I thought it was going to show) just a chance for the Wiccan horde to throw a few curses around and forget the main point of the scene which was the family running from dogs.... Very bad stuff there in my opinion. I like the small things in scenes this one just made no sense.

Also leaving out important elements of the story. Such as when the Wiccan Witch is talking about who would stand against the Bad Guy in Portland she completely left out Mt Angel and the so-called warrior monks as an ally. Granted that is something small but it sticks with me when the story drops very interesting parts like the Monks. They sound interesting but are ignored, I guess being Christians is not worth writing about. Why are they ignored? Their premise is as I said an interesting one but they are left out except for a couple of pages.

There seem to be no faults in the utopian "good guys" world. There are no turn coats or spy or killers or rapist they are all perfect. Except for the one scene with the girl complaining about being seduced by the young A-Lister and getting with baby but that is not to show anything bad it is to show off Mike Bearkillers skills at being a leader to the English Chap. Of course he fixes the problem in 20 seconds and they walk off into the sunset and we never read about it again. The Characters are just too simple even the Heroes.

Although I like Mike his wife and the English trio they are interesting. Hordle is one of my favorites but I am left with an empty character in the end. Of course the English trio and Cpt. Nobbes went from the coast of Africa to Portland without any detail what so ever which made it look silly. As I said though the little things make a story for me even if it would have just been a small plot about getting around South America or did they cross the pacific ocean did they meet any more ships on their travel did they stop off anywhere to give background to the over all story? I don't know it just beamed them to Portland without an answer to just simple questions. Did they get the Prince to safety? I guess I am left to make up my own story.

The mind numbing wiccans are just that mind numbing. I can not say much about them because I just skipped over most of the irrelevant rituals and such and singing it annoyed me. We can not find out what happened to the Prince of Wales but we can read dozens of pages of wiccan rituals and silly plots. I have nothing against wicca I know nothing about it actually but if this is what it is then it is nothing I would want to know. That might sound harsh but really if the book is accurate it is silly to me, and I am not a Christian either really more agnostic I guess I know why now. I think the old Roman Gods would be more fitting, Mars and Jupiter, Gods of War and the blade and bow and stuff such as that. Just annoying to read all the mother earth stuff to be honest. I felt I was being fed religious propaganda half the time when reading about the disfunctional "Clans". Either they were either Lord of the Rings heroes or Druids I do not know really know which I could not read the nonsense.

But it is his story and I am free to read it or not and that is what it comes down too. Of course there are some huge gaps missing:

What happened to the US Army, Marine Corp, US Navy? For 60 years the US military has stockpiled food and gear for such a world and even without rifles and tanks would make them a incredibly powerful force. They just went poof? The Dark Lord in Portland would have been far better as some egotistical General carving out his own slice of the pie. Tacoma Washington is home to one of the largest US Army bases in the country yet they just died of starvation? Not to mention the numerous Naval Bases throughout the area. At least give an explanation such as you know they killed each other off or got VXed or something. Because to be honest I would rather have the kevlar body armor and helmet of the military then chain mail from 1400. But that is just me, not my story.

That is just one huge gap I kept asking about but never found an answer.

I love the premise of the story I just think it was badly presented. No offense to anyone that loves it

Yet another fine effort from Stirling.  The finely developed plot, the alternate history that is fantastic yet plausible, and the smooth flowing story his fans have come to expect are all in evidence again.  A proven master of the genre, his characters continue to be excellent -- deep and detailed.  The plot becomes a little confusing in the middle as different threads come together via multiple flashbacks, but that could be my own fault for not paying enough attention to chapter labels.
I found the title a bit misleading, however, given the way the plot develops.  No spoilers, so I won't elaborate other than to suggest "Gathers the Storm" or somthing similar might have ben a better title.  Hopefully "A Meeting at Corvallis" will be equally entertaining

Mr. Stirling has succeded again.  Protector's War is an amazing addition to the Change Trilogy, and well worth the read.  Honestly, I don't know where to start when explaining how good it is, so I will let you know the one thing I found highly disappointing about it, in one word:
Wicca.
That's right, Mr. Sterling has filled this book with so much "blessed be's" and "Lord and Lady" junk that you have to actually wade around that gobbledeegook to get to the real story.  In fact, if it weren't for the obviously well writt and enjoyable story underneath all that dross, I'd have given this book two, maybe three stars.  Somehow I highly doubt that wicca would ever, ever evolve to become a major religion after such a massive cataclysim such as Mr. Sterling protrays here.  Likely the major religious parties of each continent would rise up again, i.e. Christianity/Catholicism in Europe and the Western Hemisphere, Anamism/Islam in Africa, Islam/Buddhism/Hinduism/Shintoism/Anamism in Asia, etc.  But Mr. Sterling not only is portraying a world where wicca is widely practiced, but one where the "Lord and Lady" actually interact with some of the characters.  Yet the characters don't sit there and think to themselves, "Hey, my gods never claim to be all nice and merciful, and they actually exist, maybe they are responsible for what happened?!"  Nope, never crosses the Mackenzies mind.  Oh, well.  My only advise to Mr. Stirling would be, keep up the great stories, but keep the preaching about wicca to a minimum.  We don't mind religions being portrayed in a positive light, and I'm personally pleased at the relative equal positive descriptions of the surviving religions, but let's try to keep to a minimum the "blessed be's" or "lord and lady" references to a religion a lot of your readers may find, well, offensive, kay

While I enjoyed most of Dies the Fire, by the end I was very annoyed with the Juniper character, and found myself skipping over the (boring) details of her wiccan prayers and outlook. I had hopes for The Protectors War, and unfortunately it's worse than it's predecessor. McKenzie and her group get far too much play, and come across as self righteous religious fanatics. The reader is dragged thru endless truly horrible chants and poems, as these people seem to have to invoke their deities with laughably stilted invocations for every thing from brushing their teeth to going into battle. I found myself skipping large chunks of this book, and the editing- switching from linear narrative to flashback in midstream- didn't help matters any. There is too much exposition, and not enough action. All in all, a boring disapointment. The third book in the series is out in hardcover, but I won't even be checking it out of the library.

Many reviewers have commented that Taylor's "American Colonies" gives indigenous peoples a larger role in North American history than most previous studies do.  This perspective is relevant to the interpretation of the American Revolution.

Among the Revolution's motives were "liberty" (a better form of government than that provided by London) and "empire" (eliminating British barriers to the colonies' territorial expansion).  Since the indigenous people were the ones most affected by the colonists' territorial expansion, giving them a larger role in the history, as Taylor does, makes the history read more in the "imperial" vein.  See chapter 18, "Imperial Wars and Crisis: 1739-75."

In an important way, the "liberty" and "empire" motives both came down to land.  The colonists knew that a key reason they were freer than the average Briton was that they could move into land acquired from the indigenous peoples.  Jefferson summed up their objective as "an empire of liberty," which Taylor uses as chapter 18's final section heading

The reviews of this book are greater entertainment than actually reading the book. It makes for hard going, however, the insights into the true American history are many. The threads of the migration of the indigenous population is more than fascinating and should be included in every textbook in schools. Yet the main disappointment, other than the fact many have complained about (ie: the death of Kamehameha), is that this a more of a professorial dissertation rather than a vibrant book, which a friend of mine from the long ago and faraway, Roxie Yonkey, also noted. This is one of those times when I wish to debate the wherefores with my dear friend

Has a pretentiousness to it that is sometimes nauseating but for the most part is a very informative well-written text by a good historian. That is, unless your car won't start before the final and he decides to give you an insanely difficult alternative the following Monday two days before Christmas.  In that scenario, his good-historian-ness flies out the window and you just hate his guts. Taylor: Not all of us come from big money! Sorry my 80s model car exploded and inconvenienced you so! Thanks for ruining my gpa!
Good book though

We all learned the basics of colonial history in school: the Mayflower; Jamestown; Tobacco; the development of New Amsterdam, Boston, Charleston, &amp; Philadelphia; indentured servants; and French trappers / Spanish Conquistadores.  However, most history books and classes spare the details about how the colonies truly developped between 1492 and about 1760.  Moreover many histories contain stunning inaccuracies about colonists and Indians.

Despite being an American History buff, it was not until finishing this excellent survey of the colonial period that I realized how little I knew.  Taylor has put together a detailed but approachable narrative of the Spanish, French, English, Swedish, Dutch, German, etc colonizers who shaped what was to become the United States.  There are plenty of fascinating details about exploration, the hardships of the first settlements and the problems faced by the expanding colonies.  More importantly, this book provides a solid background for why the English-speaking colonies prevailed and the baggage they carried entering the revolutionary period.

A well-written and well-researched book about an important era in our history that far too little is written about.  This is history that is hard to put down

Traditionally, coverage of "colonial America" is confined to the study of the thirteen English colonies of the eastern seaboard - a narrow focus that overlooks the vast scope of European involvement in North America, to say nothing of the diverse peoples who had occupied the continent for millennia before Christopher Columbus's historic voyage.  Alan Taylor rectifies this imbalance with this book, a wide-ranging survey of the first three centuries of the European presence on the continent and its impact on its inhabitants.

His scope is impressive.  After an initial chapter that provides a 14,500 year overview of the population migration that settled the continent, Taylor settles into a masterful examination of the establishment of the European colonies in the region.  The canvas is immense, encompassing the Spanish settlements of the Southwest, the exploration of Canada, and the establishment of the plantation colonies in the West Indies, as well as the colonization of the Atlantic seaboard by nearly a half-dozen European countries.  Through his account he pays particularly close attention to their interaction with the indigenous population, as well as the trans-Atlantic relations with Europe and Africa.

Taylor's macro-historical approach does not exclude the details of settlement, though.  Throughout the book, the narrative focuses on the individuals and societies of the various regions, detailing the choices they made, the factors that went into them, and how these choices shaped subsequent development.  The result is a collection of divergent stories that would all eventually be tied together (though not necessarily within these pages) into the United States of today.

As the first book in the "Penguin History of the United States," Taylor has set the bar high for the subsequent volumes.  By blending the latest scholarship and perspectives into a well-written account, he has produced a superb history of America's colonial development, one that is essential reading for anyone interested the subject and will likely remain the standard for years to come

Books like this are regrettably--but understandably--rare. Alan Taylor takes on the entire sweep of the human presence in North America up to the turn of the nineteenth century: from the earliest migrations across Beringia, to the European impact on Hawaii. It is astonishing how much he is able to include in a single, compact volume. While somewhat slanted toward an Anglo-centric account after the sixteenth century (for instance, the chapter on the West Indies from 1600-1700 is almost entirely about the British presence--Hispaniola and Cuba are completely ignored), it is only a moderate bias, admirably offset by his full and comparative accounts of the French in Canada and Louisiana, the Spanish in the southwest and California, and Russians in the northwest and Alaska. The tone of the writing, however, is exquisitely balanced and clean. In fact, the clear and efficient style is a pleasure to read, and chapter after chapter flows smoothly through the complexities and nuances of the latest and finest scholarship on the colonial era. American historians have truly brought their craft to a golden age of deep research, critical analysis and sound--yet astonishing--interpretation: Taylor's bibliography is a treasure chest of books I can't wait to read. He expertly weaves the most recent foci of American historiography--Atlantic studies, epidemiology, environmental history, pre-Columbian (and post-Columbian) archaeology, analyses of trade, demographics, gender roles, race, etc.--into the more familiar stories of explorers, empires, wars and migration. The whole story (or galaxy of stories) is thus given a structure and pattern that places what might have seemed to be arbitrary events into a tractable context. Perfect for the beginning pupil, this book is nonetheless eminently valuable for even the most well-read student of American history. It is perhaps too much to hope that the next volume in this series is as brilliantly done

Taylor provides an extensive - 526 pages including bibliography and index - overview of European colonial initiatives in the Atlantic, North America and parts of the Caribbean from the early 1400s - when Portuguese and Spanish proto-colonists got their feet wet, so to speak, by colonizing the Azores, Canaries and Medeiras - through Spanish and Russian efforts on the West Coast in the early 1800s.  Substantial space is given to colonial efforts of the French, Dutch, and Spanish as well as English settlement in the eastern Caribbean and the east coast of what eventually became the United States.

A tragic theme throughout the book is the encounter between Europeans and Native Americans that decimated the latter, primarily through inadvertent introduction of diseases but also through warfare, slavery, appropriation of their land and destruction of the environment on which the Indians relied.  Taylor also describes how the Indians repeatedly collaborated with or benefited from European traders and colonists when they perceived - often erroneously - that the Europeans' actions benefited their own economic and strategic interests.  And, yes, the Indians traded in slaves - either other Indians or Africans - as well.  The role and some of the impact of enslaved Africans on Colonial development is also described throughout the book.

Regarding the English colonies that became the original thirteen United States it's helpful for Taylor to remind that most of the colonies had unique beginnings that influenced their cultures and economies and politics for many years after the American revolution.  For example, South Carolina essentially began as a colony of the fabulously wealthy colony of Barbados, and initiated use of enslaved Africans on a scale that dwarfed the Chesapeake tobacco plantations.  And Pennsylvania started relatively late but grew quickly and prosperously as the initial English Quakers were quickly outnumbered by industrious German family farmers as opposed to indentures servants or slaves.

I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Euro-American settlement, the formative history of the United States and the interaction of Europeans with Native Americans.

The story is quite compelling as it interweaves the story of a white girl with a black community during a time period in which it was not easy.

I liked very much how softly the author gives us, the readers so much information on the lives of bees, and specially she gives a bibliography for those interested.

Although, I do not consider it a masterpiece it is very, very likable
