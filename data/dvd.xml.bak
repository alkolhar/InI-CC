There is no questioning this film is done very well. That said, it should be pointed out that it may not be for everyone. If you are not a fan of cliches, stay away from this. There are TONS of monologues that go on for long periods of time with epic music in the background, and maybe not everyone can handle that. Most of the performances are incredible, my favorite happens to be Jeff Daniels. One performance that doesn't do it for me is Martin Sheen. He shares a lot of scenes with Tom Berenger and it seems like Berenger is the one keeping those scenes afloat. C. Thomas Howell has a steady part but you won't recognize him as the kid from the Outsiders. Great battle scenes, especially the big one in the open field at the end.

After the heart-rending nobility of Abraham Lincoln's verbal tribute to Gettysburg's fallen, there is not much else that could do those men justice.

Yet GETTYSBURG does so.

This 1993 film, second in a civil war trilogy that begins with GODS AND GENERALS and concludes with LAST FULL MEASURE is worlds beyond its predecessor in cinematographic and dramatic prowess. To put it as succinctly as possible, this is a profoundly moving four hours of personalized history.

A film like this helps us to recall that we are not yet one hundred fifty years from southeastern Pennyslvania's momentary appearance as a killing field. In America's most costly war, this was its linchpin battle.

Tom Berenger and Martin Sheen turn in understated and powerful renderings of Confederate generals. Sheen's Robert E. Lee carries a mountain's weight of burden on his grieving shoulders even as he makes the decisions that will send still more Virginia gentlemen and Texas cowboys to their deaths. Jeff Daniels far outshines his earlier representation of Maine's Coronel Chamberlain, the six-times wounded college professor who would finish his working life as the president of Bowdoin College.

The panoramic battle scenes provided legions of Civil War reenactors with their glorious opportunity, one that - with the exception of a handful of volunteers who couldn't help grinning while they were being shot down - seized the day with remarkable poignance.

This one is for seeing again and again, remembering, and bowing one's head against the awful fact that nations are too often born in blood

This is one of the best movie about the civil war I've ever seen. It is the most instructive, realistic, with very good actors playing in it ! For once, just like in "Gods and Generals", the movie is more focused on the southern side, which is not very often the case.
I am a fan of this part of the U.S. history, and especially of the South, and I was really captivated by this movie from the beginning to the end

This 1993 movie, based on Michael Shaara's book The Killer Angels, is over four hours long, but it uses that time well to document this critical Civil War battle.  I used the word `document' on purpose because this movie is accurate to the point of being a documentary.  It was even filmed at the Gettysburg National Military Park.  When you see the fight for Little Round Top or Pickett's Charge, or another fight, you are seeing the events much as they happened where they happened.    

Thousands of civil war re-enactors play the everyday soldiers you see in the background and in the grand charges of this battle.  These amateur enthusiasts put their heart into this movie and it shows.     

As a high school history teacher, I was timing certain parts of the movie to show in class.  When I timed Pickett's Charge, I realized it is shown in real time.  Those Confederate soldiers charged into Union gunfire for 28 minutes and you see every moment in this movie.

Read The Killer Angels and then see this outstanding movie.

Despite the chintzy, unconvincing facial hair (Jeff Daniels' being the exception); Martin Sheen's too-gentlemanly interpretation of Gen. Lee's accent (and his beard); obvious &amp; saccharine soliloquies about the higher purpose for fighting the war; generalized (and largely inaccurate) interpretations of the underlying history of the war; and hopelessly, ridiculously, wildly off-the-mark attempts atNew England accents, the film still works.

I understand that to get a film produced and distributed, it is often necessary to have recognizable names in the cast.  But an unknown who looks more like General Lee than Martin Sheen would have been a better choice.  And C. Thomas Howell's performance--well, let's just say that his glued-on beard was more convincing than his acting.  Jeff Daniels, however, does an excellent job, in large part because he doesn't try to convince you he's from New England and consequently does not come off like Cliff from Cheers, using every stereotype associated with nasal 'r'-dropping.  Instead of focusing on the so-called nasality of  the NE accent (think of Sheen in The Missiles of Octobah), Daniels allows the viewer to suspend disbelief.  But then, here comes CT Howell again to slap you across the face and remind you that Sheen and Kevin Costner aren't the only actors who should have appeared as New Englanders in an Ed Wood production.

I think the story works because there's enough commitment to historical military fact to make it believable.  The battle scenes probably should have been more visually graphic to evoke the horror of the battle, but the movie makers either didn't have the budget for gore (maybe it was spent on the obviously fake beards) or decided to err on the side of forbearance.  If Gettysburg had been made 8-10 years later, it might have benefited from the newer style of violence-depiction, as in Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, or Gladiator.  It falls a bit short of that, however.

Finally, it should be noted that the producers/director seem to be operating on a rather simplistic view of the war's historical underpinnings, opting to represent the northern point of view as one united behind the idea of freeing the slaves. Anyone who knows about the Boston busing riots of the 1970s will understand that not all of the north is steeped in racial generosity and brotherhood. Very few who fought on the side of the blue fought because they believed in the abolition of slavery.  They fought to preserve the Union, which is a very different concept.  Abolition of slavery happened to be the issue that forced the South's hand, but it was not the sole cause of the war.  The movie dumbs this down a bit, making the message more like what you'd find in a 5th-grade text book.

The battle at Gettysburg was certainly pivotal, but viewers should remember that it did not end the Civil War.  The north absolutely needed to win it, but Lee continued to cause the North fits for almost 2 years after Gettysburg.  C. Thomas Howell will continue to cause me fits every time I think of this movie.

Still and all, the film is very watchable.  And due credit should be given to the re-enactors, arguably the greatest source of credibility for the film

Alright, Im sure you already know what its about, if not, then just read above, because im here, trying to tell you why you should watch it.


I know, Ill get this out of the way fast. Just watch this movie for what it is, not what you want it to be! People argue that its not scary, or that the twist ending was horrible. Its not a horror movie, its not suposed to scare you. Its a love story. And listen to this: the twist ending?, its not suposed to be a surprise, its suposed form this whole movie, its suposed to define who these characters are, and what they are trying to do. This is a story of love, and of hope and innocence.

I just dont see how people who are fans of Shyamalans other movies can say "I hated the ending, very predictable" because, fans, you know what Shyamalan does, you know from seeing Signs that hes a deep writer, that he gives much more meaning than what you think its going to be.

So please, if the only thing thats holding you back from seeing this is the critics, or your friends, then see it anyway. Why would you let other peoples opinions rule what you like, or dont like? Sure, many didnt like it, some didnt even understand it, but that doesnt mean you wont like it. You just have to try it out.

If you havent had the end ruined for you, thats even better, because you still have this whole movie to look forward to, and if you dont enjoy it, than fine, but atleast you can say yourself that you didnt like it. I know too many people who havent seen it because it got bad reviews.

If you enjoy a good love story, or even an art-sy type of suspence movie, then im sure you will enjoy it. But its not for everyone. Im sure, if you get bored easily, or if you dont have an imagination (this is a MUST HAVE for any Shyamalan film)

And then theres the soundtrack, which deserves 5 stars all by itself because its so magical. Shyamalan is one of the few who knows how to use music for film, who can make the music be a character in the movie. 

But before I leave, trust me, dont watch this thinking its a horror movie, because its not. Thats the worst mistake you could make aboiut this film

I guess the reason I enjoyed the movie so much was because I went into the theatre expecting a good drama. And that's exactly what I got. The story was very interesting to me. I enjoyed the relationships between the villagers, especially Lucious and Ivy.

The scary moments just added to the drama. Having grown up in the country, I know how scary the woods can be. I loved all the twists to the story.

The only thing I didn't like was William Hurt's performance. It was too hammy. I think if this critical role had been cast by another actor, the movie would've moved along at a better pace.

But still a great movie

I once thought I was almost alone in liking this creepy and fun 2004 film, but the fact is it seems to be growing on people. It just took a while for those who emerged from theaters declaring The Village a two-hour life support system for a twist ending to appreciate that there's a lot more to this movie than its concluding surprise. (No, I won't give it away, even if by now nearly everyone surely knows what that surprise is, but if you don't know, be careful about reading any farther.) What I grasped about The Village, aside from embracing a story I liked for itself, and for its ending which I didn't see coming, was a message of optimism that said it is possible for people to escape the boundaries and rules of an oppressive time and place, and recreate reality to suit their preferences. Think about that for a minute. People go scatterbrained trying to elude the dictates of our culture today, for instance, with its violence, its corporate intrusions, its governmental omnipresence, and here we saw a successful  experiment in utopian existence set in 1890, and I found that wonderful. I also loved the scenery, the muted color schemes, the attention to period detail and to the agrarian life. The performances of Bryce Dallas Howard, Joachim Phoenix, and William Hurt were also highly underrated. Never has a stretch of bare woods surrounding a meadow looked so foreboding. Never has the monster in the fairy tale been so close at hand. I liked The Village from the first day I saw it, and continue to think well of it even now

The only good thing in this movie was Ms. Howard's performance, she is innocent and believable.   I can't understand how good actors like Weaver, Hurt, and Phoenix would let themselves be wasted on this. The 'plain' dialogue among the 'elders' is painfully numbing, choppy, and stilted.  And the directing drove me crazy, especially since M. Night...insists on filming group scenes as is he was just passing through, or following them without ever bothering with close-ups. These scenes make me feel like they were done by an amateur filmmaker with a his first video camera.   If you like the back of William Hurt's head, you'll get plenty of it in this film, the camera seems to avoid his face like the plague; which is too bad, since when he finally has a good speech, we are deprived of the anger I imagine was in his eyes.  I agree with others, I would have worked better as a 30 minute Twilight Zone episode.  Rent it first before you buy, and save some money for a classic thriller, like Psycho

It's strange; this just came on FX, and once it was on, I was compelled to stay up and watch the whole thing, even though I've already seen it (in the theatres during its initial release run), and it cost me sleep to watch it all the way through this time around. 

Even for all of the bad press that this movie got, and all of the disgruntled viewers who were expecting another horror, this truly is one of my favorites from M. Night Shyamalan - this, along with "Lady In The Water" (another MUST have for me), is a movie that I feel compelled to add to my collection. As the other reviewers state, it's not truly scary, but more a suspenseful film, as I actually find ALL of Shyamalan's movies to be. In my humble opinion, he's not trying to provide movies best-suited to Halloween scare-fest marathons, but movies that are suspenseful and thought-provoking. As annoying as some of his ticks may be to some viewers, there's thought put into each of his films, unlike stupid wastes of celluloid like "Hostel" and those damned "Saw" movies (enough, already)! 

At least after seeing this in the theatre, I felt that I'd gotten my money's worth for the ticket price, and this is definitely a movie that I feel I could watch repeatedly. In my opinion, the social commentary and romantic aspects only add to the viewing experience provided by this film. Don't buy this if you're looking for a horror like "The Exorcist" - if that's what you want, buy and watch "The Exorcist". If you're looking for a film with twists and turns that tie in to a somewhat deeper meaning, and will have you nodding your head in agreement with the way things play out on screen, buy this movie. Even if you know what happens in the end, I'm sure you'll find yourself wanting to watch it again over time

It was a delight to see this childhood memory again, and in pristine quality with color (if you prefer it in original black &amp; white, turn the color down on your tv set). It brings this 60s series to a whole new generation of fans (my nephews &amp; nieces wouldn't watch it in b&amp;w)

I'm not reviewing the show itself, but rather the colorization. (If you've seen the show, you know whether you like it; if you haven't seen it, you can read the many other reviews.) The show is lighthearted fun and not to be taken seriously, but if I'm bothered by the colorization, it must be really bad. Unless you like Jeannie with orange hair and people who look like they've drunk a bottle of ink, skip this version and get the BW set.  Then you won't be constantly distracted by weird and wrong colors

There was something special about the first season.
And this has been colorized,and it realy is great the way they did that.There was a few moments you could tell it was a bit fake,but accross the board it realy has been a great effort to get it looking like this.
And if you dont like the color version,simply turn off the color on your TV!
The pilot episode is a personal favorite of mine how it got things started.Especially that bit when she came out of Toney's room with that long shirt!Oh those thigh's!
Amazingly Barbera Eden got pregnant during this season,and had to wear an extra veil to cover up her pregnancy.
I have been in love with that woman since i was about 5

 Like "lighten up already 2" said in the review of this DVD, I want historical accruacy. I wrote my opinions of the colorized versions of vintage B&amp;W shows in a review of Bewitched the Complete Second Season, which is available in a colorized version. To summarize that review, would an antique dealer ruin a valuable, antique, mahogany, piece of furniture by painting it a bright red ?

This is one of my all time favorite tv shows. Although same in concept and scope than Bewitched, this shows superior cast and performances tower over Bewitched. I believe this show was much more funnier than Bewitched. Barbara Eden stars as Jeannie and Larry Hagman stars as Cap.(later Maj.) Anthony Nelson. And Bill Daily stars as Roger Healy, Maj. Nelsons best friend.  This dvd set covers the entire 1st season (30 episodes) of the series. Since this series 1st season was shot in black and white, this is the preference for me over the alternative colorized dvd set. As far as the video and audio go, the video looks fantastic. Episodes are clean and sharp with no compression. No dirt or scratches noticeable. Audio is in clean 2.0 mono sound. All episodes are complete and uncut. The pilot episode includes a audio commentary with Larry Hagman, Barbara Eden, and Bill Daily. It's nice and pleasant but not very informative. This is the main problem I have about this set. NO INFORMATION!! To me this keeps this set from getting 5 stars. The 4 dvds come in 2 seperate cases covering all 30 episodes. On the back of the cases you get episode #, title of each episode, and small description of each one. I think there should be more info than this, so I had hoped when I played the dvds, got to the main menu, and selected an episode, I would get a small amount of trivia, some more details such as  production date, 1st broadcast date, and cast listing with special guest stars. No such luck. I had hoped for much more info about each episode. You get a 14 minute featurette with new interviews with Sidney Sheldon, Larry Hagmen, Barbara Eden, and Bill Daily, which is a nice (but short) special feature. It's nice to see them together and still very good friends. They were the backbone of this great show (along with the late Hayden Roarke). Hayden Roarke was wonderful as Dr. Alfred Bellows. I would have loved for him to have been there too. In closing this is still a great set to have, and I intend to have all 5 seasons of this great show. I highly recommend the b+w dvd version of this classic show

I love i dream of jeannie, it's just so wholesome and entertaining at the same time. The only thing I wish they've included in the DVD is English subtitles. Sometimes if you've missed what the characters are saying at least you can always check the subtitles. But other than that I'm very glad they've put the series out on DVD.

Finally, another of my favorite sitcoms is released on DVD!
I've enjoyed watching re-run after re-run of this "gem" of
a series for years. For quite awhile the first season was
not even a part of the syndicated episodes.
Barbara Eden is fantastic as Jeannie. Poor Tony Nelson
didn't realize how lucky he really was!
Larry Hagman played the part of Anthony Nelson with great
comedic timing. Larry and Barbara together made a fantastic
team!
I love the interviews with Barbara, Larry and Bill Daily.
Even today, the three of them come across as best friends.
It's no wonder they were so good together in the series!
I Dream Of Jeannie will always be one of the funniest shows
ever to grace our TV screens!
I'm not thrilled about the movie version soon to be released-
I'll stick with what is best-THE ORIGINAL!
Now I will wait for one more of my favorite shows-THE PATTY
DUKE SHOW

As a young White boy growing up on the Navajo reservation was very wonderful, this movie brought back many wonderful memories.  The Navajo friends I had, all rode mustangs so therefore our weekends were spent riding through the bueatiful high deserts of Northern Arizona.  This movie is a great movie, it has all the emotions a person may feel in the 1880's.  Some what, as I felt when we moved to Northern Arizona in 1960.  The people were wonderful to grow up with.  This movie is a great movie, the only problem I had with the DVD is that to see the Bonus Features you have to have a special computer.  I would have been happy to spend the extra money on the movie, if they could have just put it on the DVD.  I would very much like to see the extra parts that have been left out, unless you have a computer that will read these extra parts.  Other wise I would have given this movie a 5 star rating

This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.  I knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way I was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing.  I was right; I fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it.  Recently, I was offered the chance to watch it again.  I thought, "OK, I didn't see the whole thing, it might have gotten better, so I'll give it another chance." ... Bad mistake.  This little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long.  Hidalgo is the name of the horse.  So what?  That's about as boring as this movie.  So why the 1-star markup? Cause the main character is played by Viggo Mortensen, of Aragorn fame in the smash movie series The Lord of the Rings- and I do like Viggo.  I did not, however, like this movie.  It's kind of fitting it should be set in a desert- cause that's exactly where this movie should be buried, never to bore another wave of audiences again.  If you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap, watch Hidalgo; you'll be out in no time

Hidalgo is based upon a true story, so it's no wonder it's thrilling, truth being stranger than fiction and all.  Although it's highly doubtful that everything in the movie actually happened, Frank Hopkins was indeed a real life cowboy, master horseman and rider and he did participate in the great Bedouin horse race of the Middle East known as the "Ocean of Fire" in the 1890's.

This wonderfully stylized and lovingly crafted film clocks in at over two hours, yet never bores and your interest should never waver.  The international cast is terrific, led by Viggo Mortensen in a low-key, subtle performance which brings depth and a real sense of nobility to the notion of a "cowboy'.  We've seen loads of silver screen gun slingers, bandits and marshals from icons like the swaggering John Wayne to the laconic Clint Eastwood, but with Viggo's Frank Hopkins, we may now be witness to one of the most balanced and interesting portrayals of an authentic cowpoke.  And it's all the more interesting because Frank Hopkins isn't all cowboy - half of him is Native American.  This internal duality and cultural division brings character shadings and a unique sense of perspective to Hopkins.

Balancing the tensions of Native Americans with the US Government of the time, the film explores Frank Hopkin's journey between two worlds - that of a half Native American with loyal ties to his tribe and his jobs as a pony express rider and performer in Wild Bill Hickcock's show, all while having to live in the White Man's world.  When he's invited to participate in the Bedouin Race, Frank soon discovers there's a whole other world out there bound by similar dogmatic traditions, where women must hide their faces behind veils, much like he's chosen to hide his native ancestry to enable him to live an easier life.

Sweeping cinematography beautifully composes authentic locations and the stunt choreography infuses the race and the action set-ups with fun and authenticity.  Viggo must have definitely "lived" horses for the film, irregardless of his prior expertise with them.  He clearly is at the reigns of the horse most of the time and he's totally capable and always convincing.  Hidalgo the horse may qualify for his own sequel or a TV series.  This beautiful animal is more expressive than many human actors and it's just one of the many joys and reasons to give this film a chance.  Apparently lost by audiences in it's initial theatrical release, Hidalgo should be discovered by every movie lover.

Surprisingly `Hidalgo' released in '04 didn't live up to studio expectations in terms of either financial earnings, or audience appeal. Only now, two years after its release is this fantastic action/adventure film finding on DVD the adoring audience it so richly deserves. I was initially confused by this movies unexpected lack of acceptance by the public, however after pondering the complexities of this failure for some time I have come to the following conclusion. It was all Aragorn's fault. Yes, that's correct, it was Aragorn's fault. Here are the reasons why I believe this to be true.

`Hidalgo' was Viggo Mortensen's first film following his co-starring role in the massive and unbelievably successful three film production of `The Lord of the Rings.' His long matted hair, scruffy beard and moustache along with those distant, piercing eyes have been forever imprinted into the collective unconscious of every moviegoer. The shock of seeing Viggo as Frank T. Hopkins, American cowboy in a funny hat and bandana, much shorter cropped hair, clean shaven and riding on a little spotted mustang was simply too much for 'the faithful' to handle. Viggo's fan base simply wasn't ready to give up the image of the King of Middle-Earth yet. Unable to accept the new look, people stayed away from the theaters thus turning Disney's expected big drawing card into a major strategic error. To put it plan and simple, `Hidalgo' came out too soon.

If you're finally willing to move beyond the Aragorn persona and see a fast moving, well acted, beautifully shot film with a inspiring story to tell I invite you to give `Hidalgo' a viewing. Viggo is perfect as the half Indian, half white man who rides the little Pinto that never gives up and Omar Sharif delivers his best performance since `Lawrence of Arabia'. He's alert, witty and absolutely delightful as the sometimes harsh, sometimes whimsical Sheikh Riyadh who likes to sit in his tent and read tales of the American Wild West. It's obvious he really enjoyed playing this part. Also excellent performances by Zuleikha Robinson as Jazira, Adoni Maropis as Sakr and a whole cast of exotic, fascinating characters participating in the torturous 3,000 mile desert horse race across the "Ocean of Fire".

Highly Recommended

The Lord of the Rings movies made superstars out of dozens of actors and actresses.  Many have gone on to star in movies that made lots of money, but without the awards and critical recognition of the LOTR movies.  Not so with Viggo Mortensen.  Right after LOTR he followed with this awesome adventure story by Disney.  Coming out the summer after Pirates of the Caribbean, this was supposed to be Disney's next big live-action, summer adventure hit.  Unfortunately, it flopped at the box office.  Luckily, it has made a comeback on the DVD market, which is where this reviewer saw it.  All in all, it is a great movie, and probably one of the best live-action movies Disney has produced in a long while; judging from its ratings here on amazon and on imdb.com.  

In short, this movie is about Frank Hopkins, half-white, half-native american horserider who is mired in middle-age guilt and self remorse.  Along comes an opportunity for a change in scenery - a trip to the Arabian desert for a race.  Frank takes the challenge with his horse Hidalgo and of they go.  The race across the Arabian desert tests both rider and horse, and introduces them to a cast of characters that only an accomplished movie studio like Disney could have created.  We have the strong-willed girl full of innocence and inner strength, a fierce father and tribe leader who suffers no insults to his honor or intelligence, a backstabbing fellow racer who smiles until the final death, a seductive beauty willing to win at any costs, an arrogant prince with no moral bounds, etc, etc...  It all reminds our protagonist of his days in Montana!  During the course of the race, which Frank and Hidalgo win of course; both of them are tested to the limit.  The movie ends on a triumphal note for both.  The rider redeems his guilt by freeing Hidalgo from human ownership forever, and freeing his consciensce of past betrayals.

The soundtrack is awesome, the cinematography is great, the dialogue is realistic, and for once, a movie set in a foreign land that actually uses actors from that area speaking the language of that area!  My compliments to Disney and the cast and crew of this movie.  I highly recommend it to all audiences from teenagers on up

In this movie that was supposedly inspired by the true story of Frank T. Hopkins, Viggo Mortenson does an excellent job of portraying the character.  Whether there actually was the race as described in the movie and whether Frank T. Hopkins actually existed is irrelevant.  What is important is that the movie is enjoyable and the race is nicely plotted.

Frank T. Hopkins is an accomplished rider.  He has been a dispatch rider for the U.S. Army, a Pony Express rider, and he has been in Buffalo Bill's Wild West show.  Frank appears well on his way to alcoholic oblivion when he is asked to race in the 3000 mile Ocean of Fire, a race that has been held for one thousand years.  After the obligatory refusal (all movies of this type must have the humble hero refuse to be a hero) he travels by sea to the Middle East.

A side note.  The movie begins with the infamous Wounded Knee massacre.  The memory of that horrific even supposedly haunts Frank.  I will discuss these distractions more later in this review.

This movie finally comes into its own when the Ocean of Fire race begins.  Several of the sponsors of the race have their own agendas for winning the race.  Numerous attempts are made to kill Frank during the race.  Of course, Frank manages to survive all these attempts.  He also manages to rescue a kidnapped princess, and to save his horse from spikes, big cats, and bullets, not to mention heat, thirst and hunger.  Nearly every part of the movie that deals with the race is quite good and entertaining.

The title of the movie comes from the mustang named Hidalgo.  Hidalgo has a lot of heart and a lot of character.  Hidalgo was smarter than many of the characters in this movie.  Sales of horses will go up as a result of this movie.

The only issue I had with this movie was the distractions.  I thought the Wounded Knee massacre, while a horrible incident and one worthy of a separate movie, to be a distraction from the race.  Even though Frank later saw his ancestors in a hallucination in the desert, we did not need the massacre to recognize who they were.  I also thought the release of the wild mustangs by Frank could have been handled more succinctly, though I admit that seeing mustangs running across the plains of the Midwest was inspiring.  Throwing in all the details about Jazira, the daughter of Sheikh Riyadh (played by the great Omar Sharif) were further distractions.  The result is a movie that is bloated in places and begins too slowly.

I thought Viggo Mortenson was great as Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings movies.  He does an equally good job as Frank T. Hopkins.  Enjoy the race; enjoy the rescue of the princess; fast forward through the rest.

I have to say that I really enjoyed this film.  It is well done and not to mention beautifully shot. It has become one of my favorite films and is much better than most of the drivel that comes out of Hollywood these days.  Most times films are so overhyped that once you sit down to see them you are most often times disappointed.  This film did not receive that much hype and it does not disappoint.  If you love horses, adventure, beautiful scenery and a film about the spirit of man and his horse, then please do see it.  And lets face it (ladies) Viggo Mortensen is just as beautiful as the scenery around him.  He is a very good actor and an underated one at that.  So sit back, pop some corn and enjoy a good adventure.  And admire one of God's most majestic creations...........the horse. (and viggo mortensen!!

Here's an "epic" movie that reminded me of those that were made in the mid 1960s such as Dr. Zhivago and Lawrence Of Arabia. Interesting to note that Omar Sharif was in this modern-day movie and Dr. Zhivago. Several younger friends that saw this film told me they were very disappointed because, thanks to the previews, they thought it would be an action-packed adventure story such as "The Mummy." Well, it wasn't and it was way too slow for them.

Frankly, I thought the "slow" parts were the best and overall, thought the film had just the right amount of action, instead of overdoing it as the recent Mummy pictures did. Another big plus was the cinematography. This is a beautifully filmed movie, stunning in some parts. Another good point is the language: hardly a swear word.

On the negative side, there was the usual political correctness, a la Dances With Wolves in which viewers are reminded several times of the massacre at Wounded Knee and soldiers are portrayed as the bad guys. The horse race had some credibility problems, too, as "Hidalgo" came back from the dead not once but twice to race like Secretariat! 
Anyway, if you are looking for a modern-day adventure story with old-fashioned storytelling and no language problems, this film is for you and the rest of the family

My daughters ages 4 and 9 own this dvd and don't like it.  They also own the billy blanks tae bo for kids and love it.  My 9 yr. old especially likes the tae bo better.  I bought this thinking that it would give them another kind of workout, but they don't want to do this one at all.  I thought they would, and I'm sure as the other reviews have stated, love it but they didn't.  I guess it just depends on the child

Great workout for our kids &amp; us parents too....simple to follow, very effective, and our 4 kids from baby to pre-teen jump in and kick.  The coach is very optimistic and positive.  I also like the extra defense techniques shown to children.   It was very much worth the money....especially good on Rainy and Snowy Days

I would highly recommend this video if you are looking for something to motivate kids and that they can keep up with and have fun but still get a good work-out.  It is based on martial arts but does not include violence toward other people.  Instead, he picks apples and oranges and kicks soccer balls.  The video is also split up (for example, Warm Up and Cool Down) so it is easy to pause and grab a drink of water if you need one.

My kids absolutly LOVE this program. The children on the program are clearly having fun, which makes it so much more fun for the viewer, especially when the viewers are children themselves. The guy leading the group is just awesome with kids. He interacts with them throughout the entire program, and really makes it a lot of fun. My kids have seen their share of kid's exercise programs, and until we saw this one, they weren't very happy with any of them. This program really makes them feel good about themselves, and really makes them feel good about exercising. I have seen this video in the #1 spot for quite a while, but because it was priced a little higher than some of the other videos, I thought I would save a few dollars &amp; try them instead. - BIG MISTAKE!!! NOW I wish I would have bought this video first, and saved the money I spent on the other videos.  Kick to Get Fit Jr. - for kids is truly worth the few extra dollars. _ This is difinitely a case where you get what you have paid for. A few extra dollars = a much better product. - Atleast in this case it does!

I purchased this for my 4-year-old son, and we love it.  The moves are very easy to follow and extremely non-violent.  He compares the martial arts moves to picking apples and oranges versus upper cuts and jabs.  The kids in the video are just kids -- they don't perform everything perfectly so as not to make your little feel incompetent.  Great for all ages

This program is simply the best kid's program I've ever seen. I really can't say a lot that hasn't already been said in other reviews, I just wanted to also voice my opinion as to how terrific this program is.
- A couple of quick points that make this program so special are; the instructor, the program itself, and the amount of fun the kids on the program are having, and the amount of fun my children have doing the program. - The instructor has a great time interacting with the kids on the program, and also to the viewers at home. He is funny, but yet professional with his instruction, and really does a good job with the kids. - The program itself is like nothing I've ever seen before, the movements are a combination of karate techniques (with a non-violent approach), aerobic movements, and basic physical education activities, it's a very nice blend, and it really flows together well. - And last, but certainly not least, this program is FUN to do, and easy enough for all my kids to follow along with.
This is terrific program

This program is simply the best kid's exercise video I've seen - PERIOD!!!!

I usually don't write reviews, simple because most of the kid's fitness programs I've seen aren't worth the time to write about. But, Kick to Get Fit Jr. - For Kids, is completely different than anything I've ever seen. The film quality was very good, and the instructor did such a great job interacting with the kids, he's truly a natural with kids. One of the things I liked best about this program was the tempo &amp; flow, and the way the instructor just seemed to flow with the program. What I mean is, it didn't appear that he had  memorized a script (of what to say) or that he was reading word for word from a script, he just went with the flow. And, any one of us who has ever worked with kids before knows that you have to be natural with kids in order to make it fun, anything less than that will effect the quality of what you're doing. - Now, don't get me wrong, this program was well rehearsed &amp; extremely well put together, but the instructor &amp; kids were truly going with the flow &amp; having fun. - Which is definitely more appealing to the kids watching the program. - Kids enjoy watching kids having fun, and if the kids on the program are having fun, then the kids watching want to participate so that they can have just as much fun. It doesn't get much simpler than this, unfortunately most programs have no understanding of this concept and fall way short.
Kick to Get Fit Jr. - For Kids is simply the best! Check it out, your kids will love it.

One of the best movies I've seen.  Everybody does a great job in portraying this sensitive material in a very real and gutsy way.  I've seen this movie three times, I think, and each time have found it not only entertaining, but reminding that, as a society, we still have a lot of work to do on healing our human need for hatred and fear

Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of "Mississippi Burning" or the anger and impunity of "Ghosts of Mississippi", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade "Miss Congeniality" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not "a powerful film." It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like "Mississippis Burning," that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies

Grisham once said he wrote his other books, e.g., The Firm, et al., so he could afford to write important books, like this one, upon which the movie s based.  Matthew McConaghey gives a fantastic performance--and why hasn't Hollywood ever--EVER--given him another part this good!  Thought provoking, great acting, great story, highly recommen

If you like a movie with high sensual undertones and social overtones along with a surpising ending this is the movie for you.  It really covers the bases with the ignorance of some of todays socialy idealistic organizations and the pain and distruction that they cause

With a cast as strong as this one theres no wonder the film was a hit...I found myself wondering how they got all of these big ticket actors to sign onto the same film and then it hit me...this is most likely the film that launched a lot of their careers.  The story is a brutally honest one about racism in Mississippi in the year 1995.  A young black girl, ten years old, is raped and beaten by two white red-necks and when the young girls father (Samuel L. Jackson) takes revenge into his own hands and murders the two men resposible he's arrested and a trial is held.  The film revolves around this mans lawyer mostly, Jake (McConaughey) as his family and practice is placed under fire by a newly reformed KKK as his home is scortched and his partners are harassed and his wife and child are forced to leave town for their safty.  The film calls into account morality over law...whats right and wrong isn't always black and white and not so easily determined.  Acting on all fronts is strong, but it's Jackson who proves to be the light in this film as his tortured father suffers with every breath as he recounts what his baby went through.  Kevin Spacey, Sandra Bullock, Oliver Platt, Keifer &amp; Donald Sutherland, Ashley Judd and Chris Cooper all give brilliant performances in this powerhouse of a film that benifits from a great script and a steller cast

     THis is one of my favorite movies. Besides containing a stellar cast (Matthew McConaughey, Sandra Bullock, Sammuel L. Jackson, Oliver Platt, DOnald AND Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Spacey) You get the idea. Is there a cast member that ISN't a biggie? The casting is Genious, and the acting incredible. It's suspenseful, deep, VERY emotional.. slightly dark.. it's the perfect movie. Even the rape scene is well done by being comfortably vague while still haunting you. 

     A Time to kill's plot is pretty simply explained.  In the deep south, a 10 year old black girl is raped by two wite rednecks, who almost kill her. A young white lawyer and father (Matthew McConaughey as Jake Brigance) is sickened at the news, and doesn't quite know what to think when the little girl's father (Sammuel L. Jackson as Carl Lee Hailey) pays him a visit and asks if he'd "help him if he were in a tight spot".  The next day as the two redneck/monsters are being led up the stairs of the courthouse to their arraignment, Carl Lee Hailey pops out of a storage clauset with a machine gun and blows away the two young men that raped his daugher. 
    Jake Brigance agrees to defend Hailey as his murder trial begins. The insanity plea is used to "give the jury an excuse to aquit" But in my opinion, I think it was quite legitimate. What father WOULDN't be driven insane under the circumstances?  the rest of the movie is Carl Lee Hailey's trial and the surrounding Drama as KKK violence emerges led by Kiefer Sutherland, and Jake's life and home are in danger, his relationship with his wife strained, and his career are seriously on the line in what seems to be a loosing battle.  
      My favorite scene? It might come as a surprise, but my favorite scene is when the Prosecution calls to the stand the policeman who was leading the two rednecks up the stairs to their trial. He was caught in the knee by a stray bullet, and now has half a leg.  After the prosecution use the witness to incite rage against Carl Lee, and establish unerring identity of the shooter, The Defence asks him two questions. 
"Do you think Carl Lee intentionally shot you?" 
"No" 
"Do you think he should be sent to prision for what he did?"
"He did what I would have done."
but it doesn't end there as the Policeman (remember he's missing a leg because of what Carl Lee Hailey Did) becomes very emotional and boldly confesses that if someone raped his little girl he would blow him away just like Carl Lee did. He starts screaming to the jury to "turn him loose, He's a hero!"  I think this is one of the most emotion packed and well acted scenes (albeit there are many others too) (Great acting by Chris Cooper as the policeman) 

Anyway.. forgive if I rambled. I love this movie and if you like courtroom dramas... star studded casts.. John Grisham...suspense thrillers..just all around good movies.. You need to see this.

Every writer is important. A writer that has views, characters, and exciting trial cases. This movie is originally based off of john grisim's first novel. A novel that he sturggled to get out there and then finally had it self-published. It's a powerful story that has a very dark setting. There's rascism, there's fights, there's deaths. Everything that this wolrd wants to avoid. I think samuel jackson played a really powerful performacne and I hope he got an oscar for this role. Just to warn you, though, that there are images in here that are hard to see. I , myself, fastforwarded one scene because I couldn't handle it. It's near the begining. But I hope you people enjoy the cast of characters and get captured by this huge story

This is by far John Grisham's best books and movies of all. Although this was John's first book, it wasn't successful until one of more of his other books became successful. After the popularity of other books such as the firm this book hit the best sellers list. Then comes the subject of making this book into a movie. When John Grisham was foirst approached about turning it into a movie, he was somewhat reluctant because he felt the subject matter was to sensitive. He felt that without his input, the movie could not reflect what Grisham was trying to present in the book. After several of John Grisham's books were made into movies and were successful, I knew it was only a matter of time before "A Time To Kill" would be on the big screen. This movie is a great reflection of the book and maybe so because John Grisham had some influence over the production. The movie has an all star cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Matthew McConaughey, and Kevin Spacey. This movie is one of the best books turned into movies of the last thirty years. This DVD should be apart of everyone's movie collection. As this book will surely be a literary classic for hundreds of years to come, the movie will also be.

John Grisham's powerful novel about persistent racial conflict in the South  was transformed ten years ago into a gripping film by Joel Schumacher with the screenplay adaptation by Akiva Goldsman.  The reporting of an act of violence by an African American father whose daughter had been kidnapped, brutally beaten, raped, and further debased brings together a rookie lawyer whose involvement with the father during the prolonged trial results in a suggestion that there may be hope for harmony, even on a small scale, if the racial lines can be erased or even blurred a bit.

Matthew McConaughey is the rookie white lawyer, Ashley Judd his wife, Samuel Jackson the father, Sandra Bullock the bright wannabe lawyer who assists McConaughey, Kevin Spacey the brilliant but slimy lawyer opposing McConaughey, Oliver Platt as McConaughey's sidekick, Donald Sutherland as the disbarred drunk of a lawyer who cleans up his act to help McConaughey find the truth justice knows, Patrick McGoohan as the implacable judge, and Kiefer Sutherland as the KKK redneck representing all the evil of the little southern town. It is a fine cast and Schumacher moves them naturally between their lives in the town and the interior of the courtroom with great facility.  

Perhaps this will never be considered as one of the 'Great Movies', but is certainly pleads the case for understanding and for putting an end to the evils of racial bias. Recommended.  Grady Harp, January 0

John Grisham's novel, "A Time to Kill" is closly adapted into a major motion picture by director Joel Schumacher.  Rated "R" for language and violent content (including a scene dipicting the rape of a ten year old girl), the film contains not only strong content but strong performances from a number of "A" list stars.  

Samuel L. Jackson plays Carl Lee Hailey, the father of the raped girl who takes out his revenge against the rapists by shooting them in cold blood as they are being escorted to their arraignment.  Young and inexperienced local attorney, Jake Brigance (played by Matthew McConaughey in one of his first major roles) agrees to defend Carl Lee against the smarmey District Attroney Rufus Buckley (played by Kevin Spacey).  Brigance is helped with the case by the unlikely trio of Sandra Bullock (playing a well-to-do law student), Oliver Platt (a morally devoid divorce attorney) and Donald Sutherland (a drunken disbarred lawyer who gave Brigance his first job).  As the plot builds, the community begins to takes sides in the case.  The KKK is called in to intimidate Carl Lee's defense team and the NAACP enters to counteract the Klan's actions.

In some reviews, the film is panned as being poorly written and unbelieveable.  This reviewer found the film fairly well done and true to the book.  Without revealing any key plot details, let me suffice to say that the film is true to the novel and portrays the Deep South in a accurate way.  There's plenty of action, few down moments and sparkling performances by a great cast!  If you liked the book, you will enjoy "A Time to Kill".

My son is 6 and I bought this for him to help him prep for 1st grade. He loves it and watches it every morning before school. He chooses to watch it over Nickelodeon and CN. After he watches one or two videos, we discuss them and later, we sing them. He has already learned heaps of math, grammar and US history. The latter is important because we live in Japan and I'm trying to see that he learns about his "other" nation. I also want to see him maintain his English as the school system pours more and more Japanese on him. School House Rock achieves all of these goals and more. The 2 disk set is also well-designed, with alot of extra animations. This is a must-have for any school-aged child, and as a GenX-er I never get tired of watching it, either. Solid, show-quality songs. Engaging, funny animation

This is a good video for kids.  It worked for me along time ago.  I learned the preamble from this video and to this day if I need to recite the preamble I sing it.  Not only the preamble, you learn spanish, bill to a law, conjunctions.... this video is timeless.
If you have kids get this for them, makes at least the basics for 5 subjects in school easier for them

For those of you whose children grew up with "Conjunction Junction" and other Grammar Rock songs, it is probably  time for you to buy this DVD set for your grandkids! This collection has all of the songs that you remember (and probably some that you don't!) I recommend playing it on your computer for easier navigation to the videos that you want to see. I do not recommend downloading the software that comes with it. It was quite difficult to navigate. Simply use the media viewer that you already have installed on your computer. I really give this product 5 Stars; the 2 star rating was an accident that I can't remedy.

The story of "Alice in Wonderland" was controversial from the moment that the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, aka Lewis Carroll, wrote it.  Some took the story as horror rather than a childhood fantasy.  Others consider Alice's journey as a trip into or through insanity.  For better or worse, Disney did capture many of these elements, and the same criticisms of the books that form the basis of this film apply to the film.  However, there are also those who loved the books and loved the film.  Normally I recommend Disney classis without reservations.  In the case of this movie, I will keep a couple of provisos.

Alice is a young girl bored by her lessons.  As the length of the lessons grows, Alice soon drifts off, until a white rabbit passes by, muttering to himself that he is late.  Alice follows the white rabbit and falls into a rabbit hole that seems to fall forever.  Luckily for Alice her dress opens out into a kind of parachute and slows her descent.
Once at the bottom of the hole, Alice discovers a door into which she is unable to pass because the door is too small.  However, there is a vial labeled "drink me" that Alice discovers makes her small enough to go through the door.

Alice is soon on her way into a series of surreal adventures that are in the best tradition of adult animation.  Indeed, Alice might have worked better as an adult story given the number of references to adult vices and frailties throughout the film.  Even the fundamental basis of Alice's journey through Wonderland owes as much to psychological references as it does childhood fantasies.  The ending of Alice's journey in particular is quite frightening, especially to younger children, embodying all that can be horrible in nightmares.  I remember seeing "Alice in Wonderland" as a child, and I remember I thought the ending was scary, and I was relieved when Alice was able to escape back to the normal world.

Given that this film is well over fifty years old, I was disturbed by the smoking caterpillar, if for no other reason than our current knowledge of what smoking does.  The smoke did negatively affect Alice as it made her cough.  Perhaps there is an object lesson for children here.  While some consider many of the references to allude to drugs, I think that is a modern interpretation.  I think eating or drinking items to get larger or smaller was merely a convenient plot device for the author rather than an allegory for drug use.  Remember that this story was first published in 1869.

I believe this film is excessively criticized by those who do not like its style and the post-era associations with negative elements that were never intended by the original author and by Disney.

For all these provisos, this film is excellent.  It matches "Fantasia" in its surreal visions, and the construct and tying together of the individual stories is superb.  The animation is marvelous as well, readily illustrating the vision of Alice's journey.

This movie is one of those rare Disney films that I am unable to recommend to all viewers.  Whether you will enjoy this film is strictly a matter of personal taste.  If you enjoy animation oriented toward adults, then you may find this animation a treat.  If you are open-minded about the story and consider when the story was written and animated, you may also find that you enjoy it.  I do recommend this movie for slightly older children, perhaps 8 and above, considering some of the disturbing images.  Good luck!

Walt Disney's Alice in Wonderland is one of my favorite animated films. Some great characters in this one, the smoking caterpillar, chesire cat, the queen of hearts, the mad hatter, and of course that busy White Rabbit. Alice in Wonderland is such a sweet, sensitive and quite risque film, clearly the caterpillar isn't smoking incense but this film is classic, I love it so much. I can't wait til my nephew starts watching this film. Other Disney films I enjoy include: The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, and The Lady and the Tramp. I highly recommend Alice in Wonderland, could this movie be any better? I think not

Disney's "Alice in Wonderland" is one of their most underrated animated masterpieces that finally gets the 2 disc special edition treatment that it so very much deserves.  The animation is pleasing to the eyes, the songs are pleasing to the ears, and Alice's adventures are charming and interesting to behold.  The classic childhood story written my Lewis Carroll, is given a brilliant boost with great animated characters that bring Alice's adventures to glorious life.  Kathryn Beaumont give's Alice a voice that is so sincere with each amazing discovery in the Land of Wonder, so that the character seems more real than simply animated.  Kathryn also does a great job as the voice for Wendy in Disney's "Peter Pan."  This dvd release is loaded with tons of extras that are very enjoyable to watch.   I especially like the Walt Disney tv special, starring Kathryn Beaumont and Bobby Driscoll (Treasure Island) that introduces "Alice in Wonderland" to the public and features excerpts from "Song of the South" and other Disney films.  I highly recommend "Alice in Wonderland : The Masterpiece Edition" to fans of classic Disney animated films and to fans of animated childhood stories and fantasies.  "Alice in Wonderland" is a beautiful daydream that definitely should not be missed

Not only does this film was exquisitely made for a different audience by Disney, but they were able to capture the real message implicitly stated in Carrol's book; here, we are able to succumb into the fantastic wonderlands brought upon by psychedelics, and more often than not, one is constantly reminded about the useless games and parodies we set ourselves with on a daily basis. Alice realizes that something has happened, but is not able to handle all this nonsense, which in fact are just a product of her own mind. Most importantly, I believe, is to watch this film under a preferred state of consciousness as to better appreciate the subtle messages the producers wanted to put across, and luckily, by the end of the film, you can ask yourself: Who am I?

There's certain sequences in Disney films that are so memorable they tend to get parodied or they're referenced more than the actual movie. The spaghetti scene in Lady and the Tramp. Bambi's mother in that movie, or the pink elephant scene in Dumbo are examples of scenes that are just as memorable as the films. So it's odd that so many of Alice's scenes are pop culture even when it didn't have the warmest welcome on release. Granted we're not talking Disney's masterpiece level but still, it's quite a quirky movie.

Alice is receiving lessons when she sees the reflection of a rabbit in the water. She follows it and stumbles down a long hole and enters the world of Wonderland. She ends up seeing a long list of quirky situations including Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the Mad Hatter, Queen of Hearts, talking flowers and the White Rabbit.

Even though it's a film unto itself, many of its scenes are referenced in other films are they're just pop culture iconic scenes. And of course the Matrix brought it back by using the rabbit hole and white rabbit imagery. The film however didn't get the biggest response as people were confused by it and found it odd. It's even written Walt himself apologized for it although it became popular after it was on a television show edited down.

This is probably the most atypical film Disney's released, although other films such as Emperor's New Groove or Atlantis are quite different. While those 2 were pretty devoid of characters breaking out into song, Alice has a bunch of songs. The imagery of course is odd as we get walking pencils, talking flowers, tears turning into raging waters and a cat who has a habit of disappearing. You can obviously tell why critics couldn't understand it. It's still cited as one of Disney's more better "smart" films such as Fantasia.

You should check it out? Of course but word of caution: by no means are you going to see a quintessential Disney classic but still you'll probably like it and enjoy it...probably

I expected so much more from this movie, I guess since the cast included two of my favorite actors (Jolie &amp; Washington) and also had the always on point Queen Latifah as well.  I watched with full expectation to absolutely love this movie, but I walked away bitter with shattered expectations.  First off I will say that Latifah was wonderful here and she proved as the only reason I smiled on occasion during this movie experience.  Washington and Jolie on the other hand were so unbelievable (especially Washington who really strained in this role) that I was constantly asking myself "do I really like these two?" and I had to remind myself of movies like 'Gia' and 'Training Day' to answer with a resounding "YES!"

The film follows a rookie cop (Jolie) as she helps a quadriplegic ex-cop Lincoln (Washington) track down a serial killer mimicking the killings detailed in a book called 'The Bone Collector'.  The ending is really annoying since the revelation of the killer, while not who you'd pinpoint, is not of any significance and so it manages to stir up absolutely no emotion whatsoever.  It's like "oh so he/she did it...interesting"...and I'm bored.  I'd skip this one for it becomes generic within the first five minutes and stays that way until the credits finish rolling

I was very pleasantly surprised at this film. Denzel Washington proves again that he can handle any role that he chooses to play. In this case, he plays homicide inspector, Lincoln Rhyme who has been nearly paralyzed after suffering from an accident in the line of duty. But now, when a mysterious killer begins killing off people in a very peculiar matter, he must team with a hard-headed rookie cop (Angelina Jolie) to solve the crimes. Supporting cast includes Queen Latifah, Michael Rooker, Mike McGlone, Luis Guzman, Leland Orser and Ed O'Neil. 

I like the way they have the killer as an intelligent person. Someone who has a knowledge of what he is doing. And the way he leaves clues for the cops to follow. To come up with something this perfect, you must a genius. While not really scary, this suspense thriller is actually thrilling as opposed to the many number of "thrillers" that are not even thrilling. (Example: HANGMAN). Thank you Hollywood for giving us THE BONE COLLECTOR. This is a good one. Highly recommended.....5/

Philip Noyce is a very smart filmmaker. And once more he confirms it through this intense and intriguing psychological picture around a notable expert forensic (Denzel Washington)  sadly a bedridden quadriplegic who joins forces with a witty female agent (Angelina Jollie) to intend by all their means to get a mysterious serial killer around the low belly of NYC.

Smart clues, notable shots, first rate direction, kinetic script make of this movie one of the five most solid thrillers in the Nineties according the tradition of Silence of the lambs as well as an underneath homage to "The rear window", if you carefully establish the visible connections, due if James Stewart was a visible peeping tom at those times, Denzel Washington is the scrutinizing cyber eye. The paradigm remains, and just the form changes. 

Highly recommended.

Bone Collector

Upon the opening scene of the movie, I was highly upset.  It was only after the movie had begun that I realized I didn't buy a porn.  C'mon!  Bone Collector!?  That was a clever little marketing ruse you did there Universal.  Nice one.  You won't get me again.

It's a psycho-sexual thriller, with Angelina Jolie hitting on a genius gimp who has a knack for riddles, nuts and bolts, and jigsaw puzzles.  This guy is so smart he could probably beat Ken Jennings in Jeopardy.  He even has an awesome, magical straw that controls one of those Tempur-pedic beds.  He can make the bed recline with a magic straw!!  Unfortunately, he didn't do the bowling ball and wine glass trick.

Together with the gimp and his incredible pull within the police force that he is no longer a member of, Jolie (who is transferred from to homicide because she used a dollar bill to measure something) begins to unscramble the riddle of corpses, clues, comic books, and ancient steam pipes, leading to a super-duper surprise hunky-dory ending in which everything is perfect, and butterflies land on retarded kids' heads.  Only, there are a few major plot-holes:
1)	There is no way that Jolie would have switched departments.
2)	There is no way that Washington would have had that much pull.
3)	There is no way the serial killer would have left all the clues when he could just go for his main target to begin with.
4)	The clues that are so cleverly figured out don't even lead to figuring out who the killer is.

Things learned from this movie: 
-Ed O'Neill is more versatile than the Al Bundy role.  
-Make sure to never get into a cap driven by other than an Arab guy.
-I hate the fact that Queen Latifah, a person as talented as a stick of butter, has somehow managed to squeeze into a small sliver of celebrity.  The fifteen minutes have been over for quite some time now.  Leave.

In the end it's a mediocre movie from which I expected more.  Given the combo of Washington and Jolie, there really should have been greatness.  It's a preposterous renter at best

This movie is just so tragically non-believable, that it irritates the viewer and you have to quit on it. 

Good cast, but what stupidity in the script. Are they serious letting us believe that a serial killer is re-enacting crimes from an almost 100-year old novel.

And so Angelina Jolie goes to a decades abandoned meatpacking storehouse and can still smell the manure??????

Duhhh --- the place has been abandoned for decades. More non-believably, you mean to tell me a real estate developer hasn't snatched up the property and razed the building. That it has sat undisturbed so that even the manure is intact decades later?

I'm sorry -- when movies use plot devices so amateursishly like this, I bail on the whole project.

I really enjoy the House of Elliot. The series starts off well with two sisters going into the dress-making business and opening up their own successful shop. Season 2 ditches some of the old villains (the scheming relatives) and introduces a French designer and a banker as the antagonist/s of the season.

Again, as with the first series, I like the character Bea a bit more than I like Evie. Evie's antics don't really excite me that much. She seems the more selfish and inconsiderate of the two. I also don't find myself enraptured by the Jack/Bea romance. While I enjoy both characters individually, I see Bea as too independent to settle down and become the perfect wife. Also, I don't really care that much about the film industry, so watching Jack 'on the job' doesn't hold that much appeal.

Still, this was a solid season and its nice to see the sisters be successful for once

Any word on if/when Series 4 of The House of Eliott will be released on DVD?  I, too, found the last episode of Series 3 to be quite a cliff-hanger and I would surely be looking forward to seeing what happens to Jack in Parliament as well as how Evie will fight for her couturier part in the design house.

Any word would be appreciated

I thoroughly enjoyed Seasons 1, 2 and 3 of the House of Eliott.  The acting was fantastic, the dresses magnificent and the locations, as with most English mini-series, marvelous.  My only complaint is that it doesn't end!!  THere is no closure to this.  As you approach the last chapter of Season 3 you start to wonder how they are going to wrap it all up in the little time that is left, and - oh surprise! - things are left unsettled and you feel that you need one more season to see how things worked out for everyone!  Is there any chance that there is a Season 4 out there somewhere????

I greatly enjoyed both Series 1 and 2.  The costumes are spectular.  The plot can be a little tedious at times, but there is an impressive cast of different characters coming and going throughout the series.  It's also pleasantly predictable, so a lot of fun.  My only complaint is that the last episode is a mild cliff hanger, and later episodes aren't available.  My compliments to amazon.com for carrying these reviews.  It was the only place I found that indicated that there are more episodes to come on DVD.  Not even the BBC.UK website provided that information!  Thanks, Amazon and volunteer reviewers

Yes, it is that funny.  The humor in this film alternates between exceedingly subtle and understated to borderline farce in a worthy successor of Rob Reiner's THIS IS SPINAL TAP, in which Christopher Guest costarred, and predecessor to Guest's later masterpieces BEST IN SHOW and A MIGHTY WIND.  Reiner in his film created the mockumentary comedy genre, in which characters largely ad libbed their parts while everything was filmed as if it were a documentary.  Guest has in three films now masterfully emulated Reiner's style, assembling a group of actors he prefers to use over and again.  Almost all of the central actors have appeared in two or more of these films and several in all three.

Unless one prefers dumbed-down slapstick, this is comedy just about as funny as it comes.  The first time I saw it I don't think I really caught on until the scene where Blaine, Missouri's (the film was actually filmed in Texas) town historian recounted how Blaine was founded after wagon train leader Blaine Fabin mistakenly told the settlers that they were in California near the Pacific when in fact they were in Missouri.  

The plot is rather simple.  In honor of the 150th anniversary of Blaine's inadvertent founding, a day of celebration is being held that will be capped by a locally written and produced musical revue.  Corky St. Clair, an obviously gay theater person who has fled New York for the small town, takes on the challenge of directing.  The bulk of the movie consists of auditions, rehearsals, and the final performance of the musical.  The title stems from the hope that a Mr. Guffman of a New York theatrical company will be in attendance.  

This film was literally made up as they went along.  My understanding is that they ended up with dozens of hours of footage out of which Guest had to craft a final film.  While move films are refined in the editing phase, this one is unique for being created at that stage.  Because most of the dialogue is made up as the cameras roll, a film like this takes a special cast of actors.  Veterans of improv like Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy and stand ups such as Fred Willard are to be expected, but what is so great is how people you wouldn't automatically think would excel in the form, such as the always delightful Parker Posey, do so.  By way of trivia, the part of the play's narrator is played by Lewis Arquette, son of Cliff Arquette and father of all those other Arquettes, including Rosanna, Patricia, and David.  And I'm sure all ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT fans will love the UFO expert, played by none other than Tobias himself, David Cross (famed himself for ad libbing many of his lines on that show).

One of the best jokes in the movie occurs in a "Three Months Later" coda that finds out where the principal performers in the musical have ended up.  Corky is back in New York, hoping for tryouts (perhaps as Henry Higgins in a revival of MY FAIR LADY).  The joke comes when we find out he is running a Hollywood memorabilia store, where one of the hottest items is a MY DINNER WITH ANDRE action figure set.  For those who haven't seen the film, the only thing that happens in the entirety of the movie is Wallace and Andre talk while seated in a restaurant.

I've learned the hard way that this and Guest's other films aren't for everybody.  Not everyone seems to "get" them.  This astonishes me since I find these films funnier than anything else coming out of Hollywood these days.  But for whatever reason, so people are not capacitated for some reason to enjoy them.  But for those who are, these films are priceless gems

Apparently this is one of those "cult" movies that has a small but dedicated following, even though most people have never heard of it. Nothing wrong with that, but be aware that the reviews you'll read here are from a VERY skewed sample of movie fans. I love good comedy, and so does my wife, but both of us found this movie terminally dull. It's basically a one-joke movie -- the joke being that the people in it (the characters, not the actors) are totally untalented, but also totally oblivious to that fact. So they just keep on doing their unfunny bits. 

"Waiting for Guffman" does not appear on the American Film Institute's list of 100 Funniest Movies. Nor is it on the IMDB list of 50 Top Comedies, as rated by thousands of movie fans. So anyone who tells you this movie is the "funniest movie ever" or "hilarious" is definitely out of the mainstream.

I'll give Guest and his usual crew credit for doing something a bit off the beaten path. The improv/mockumentary format has the potential to be funny, but in this mess of a movie, it doesn't work very well. There are some funny bits (David Cross is always a stitch) but too much of it just falls flat. It feels like something that would have worked on SNL as a 10-minute sketch, but as a full-length movie it just CRAWLS. 

OK, I've said my piece -- and I'm sure that I'll get lots of "not helpful" ratings from the movie's rabid fans who make up the majority of the folks that will check out this title. But if you're not a fan of slow, dry, improvisational movies, be warned: you won't find "Waiting for Guffman" very amusing

This is a really great and hilarious movie. If you're a Christopher Guest fan, and you like "Spinal Tap" and "A Mighty Wind", you'll love this one as well.  It's got a lot of the same people that are always in his movies, like Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara, and they're all always great together.  Also, David Cross is hilarious as the UFO nut.

Definitely buy this movie.  And don't forget to pick up a "Remains of the Day" lunchbox while you're at it

Waiting for Guffman is an awesomely funny movie!  It's shot just like a low cost documentary would be shot - awkward transitions, bumbling soliloquies and strange zoom action.  The characters are wonderful.  Guest got everything just right from the travel agent wearing white athletic socks with his loafers to the over-exuberant Blaine Community Players.  The movie was full of slapstick humor along with witty, thoughtful humor as well.

What's great about this movie as well is that you're not just laughing at the characters, you're getting excited about the Blaine Sesquecentennial right along with them!  The songs are catchy (in a frighteningly annoying kind of way), and you find yourself tapping your foot along with the song and dance review.  

If you have seen other Guest movies, I would say this one ranks in the middle for me (Best in Show is my favorite, Waiting for Guffman, then A Mighty Wind).  I think this one captured the excitement and hilarity of small-town pride and revelry.  Loved it!  Favorite line: "I hate you, you... bastard people...  You're all bastard people!

Having known a few people who fancy themselves as creative types , it was a fun experience to watch this . One could argue that this misguided feeling that people have is one of the main concerns of Christopher Guest - it may be a limited view of people , but it is also a predominant problem for most of us .

I would feel confident in saying that many of us have had to deal with a colleague who thinks they are wonderful . I don't mind that so much . For me , the problem comes when those types are put in charge of a group of people .

This film can be seen as a comedy or as a good example of putting together a group of people who are more than a little self-centred . You will see the psychological game playing going on . It is a film for anyone who has ever been involved with amateur dramatics , or amateur anything .

You will notice that Mr Guest has made a number of other films like this and they are all entertaining . I encourage you to see them all for the characters - the rich tapestry of humanity we all deal with every day

I think that for a first time writer/director Vanessa did a great job.  The story is based on her real family to some extent and the town she grew up in, which is VERY similar to the film and the movie was filmed there as well.  It's a movie about family like nobody could ever imagine.  This family is real, and i know them all because they are my family as well.  Others say this family is impossible to exist but THEY DO......slightly less dramatic but its all there.  I think it's great

Horrible family you care nothing for, and nobody you'd want in your own, and that's saying a lot since every family on earth is dysfunctional.  Even the nutty grandmother makes you want to slap her.  Hell, I really want to slap everyone on the cast, crew, and the writers.  I bought this for 5 bucks, and it wasn't worth 5 cents.  These people are unsympathetic, unbelievable, and totally made up.  The women wear too much eye-liner and spend most of the film rolling their eyes at each other and showing their midriffs.  I bought the movie because of Johnathan Schaech (based--okay--on his pretty face and his presence in That Thing You Do), but he's not even in it that much.  He's better looking than all the girls in it too--including the phony poser lesbian with the fabulous midriff when Alyssa dumps her.  I fast forwarded through this after the first half, pausing occasionally to hear dialogue that made Dumb and Dumber look like  Hemingway.  

In summation, if you like this movie, you have been dumbed down by the evil Hollywood machine, and I suggest you check out good foreign films like A Good Marriage and beautiful scandals like Valmont immediately.  There is no excuse for liking unmoving, plastic dreck of this nature.

Character studies of dysfunctional families is a fairly common comedy device.  However, in most such efforts, there are enough likable traits to counterbalance the unlikeable ones.  We found no redeeming qualities in any of the major characters.  Even the bride (who is supposed to carry the film) seemed fake and unlikeable.  We watched about 20 minutes of this DVD and ditched it in favor of something else.  For a much better "quirky family" movie, wait for "The Family Stone" to come out on DVD

This is how that "Greek Wedding" movie should have been done! Its sweet without being schmaltzie. Its gritty without losing heart. I like to think of this film as that "other wedding film" on ecstasy (in a very flattering way). It was written, produced, directed, and starred the very talented Vanessa Parise. Keep your eye on this young woman folks, she is going places

Sibling rivalry. An overbearing father. Great Italian food. Small town versus big city life. Family bonds. Life choices. Handsome men. Four beautiful sisters. So much to relate to. Emotional, fun and definitely worth buying

I'm usually not into reality tv shows (never watched one for more than one episode) however, when i started watching the apprentice i immediately became addicted to it. It is by far the best reality show ever created. Not only its entertaining but most importantly, its educational. It gives the viewers a chance to see and experience secondhand many aspects of many types of businesses and how people from different backgrounds work together (or not)...

Also, Trump shares so much of his knowledge in doing business that just those insights are enough reason to buy this dvd...

Highly recommended!

The Apprentice Season 5 is being shown on Hong Kong TV each Monday and I can't believe both my 15-year-old son and I have arranged our social schedules around this one-hr TV show on Monday evening.   We are absolutely hooked on it and can hardly wait for the next episode.   Why does it take so long for Season 2,3 and 4 to come out in DVD?    This is an ideal gift for anyone with good taste for a good TV serial.

'The Apprentice' should hardly be evaluated as the underdog of reality television.  Slickly, but sharply presented, it provided a petri dish of capitalism with the drama that can't fail to enthrall a NYSE broker or an unfamiliar novice.  The elements are assembled expertly by 'Survivor' creator, Mark Burnett, and The Donald.  Editing certainly was one of the main ingredients of success, but the candidates are captivating enough to make season one an absorbing serial drama.  Alumni Bill Rancic in his autobiographical business memoir, called 'The Apprentice,' a game show.  Deference should be showed for his evaluation, but they could have fooled us.  It seems more like a simulation.  


Season one comes together serendipitously for three reasons:  the task, taskmaster, and the takers.  Mystery pervades every episode with a colorful group of contestants, an assignment with a different business aspect provided, and an elimination round that is suspenseful and skillfully prepared.  (What will they have to do?  How will they get their act together?  Who will get fired?)  Then, in the middle of the episode, The Donald has a cameo appearance where he expounds on the business lesson or principal, usually highlighting a contestant's later actions.  It could have come across as a schmaltzy business lesson, but his folksy, no-nonsense lecture becomes an illuminating intermission.  

Season one works well for the cast of characters.  (And, as contestants, there are plenty here!)  The first season was not just successful because of viewer curiosity, it worked because the first group had less talent and accumen and more heart and colorful personalities overall.  There was a savvy, charismatic businesswoman from Texas (Amy), a colorful cowboy from Boise (Troy), a brash, but spunky New Yorker (Heidi), a smooth and learned broker (Kwame), and a calm and hard-working entrepreneur from Chicago (Bill) just to name a few.  The serial drama seems genuine and not forced.  (The premise contained risks that could have been a disaster.)  The plot thickened with alliances that were made and broken, but more interesting was the love interest of Amy and Nick.  Both the couple and the producers captured the relationship in a way to keep it from overtaking the main story, but the presentation kept us guessing whether it was genuine love or a ploy at office politics.  Furthermore, a villain was added to the mix.  Omarossa Manigault-Stallworth--forgive me for the misspelling!--formerly worked for the Clinton administration and had the political skills to throw a wrench into everything.  She wasn't rationalizing when she said she was way too creative to take a job with Donald Trump.  On 'The Apprentice' website, she wrote that never was so much good come from being so bad.  (It turns out that she's had the most follow-up stories.  An aspiring actress, she's been successful for Halle Berry's 'Catwoman' and a UPN soap opera.  Maybe she was grooming to be the next Erica Caine/Susan Lucci all along.  In a recent book, Trump himself called her "the most articulate" of all the first year contestants.  I thought the same, but have to give him the credit.)  Not to spoil discoveries with details, but Nick's honesty and chauvenism, Amy's perfectionism, and Heidi's family drama are just a few developments added to keep our interest. Seldom have people on a reality show been more endearing than with this ensemble.   

Upon the debut, we all became armchair quarterbacks, calling them out for dumb plays and wrongly calling out the Donald for some executive decisions.  (When he fired Omarossa, I thought he did it at the worst time, when she was at her finest form and the only one on her team to produce.  However, results are everything.  He didn't get to be a billionaire for bad judgment!  To rephrase 'SNL', "He's The Donald.  And You're NOT!")   

And, that's where the success falls apart.  Sam correctly distinguished the difference between good candidacy and good television with his 'Apprentice' website commentary.  To paraphrase, a good strategy and engaging television can often come at cross-purposes.  True to himself, after season one Donald Trump showcased bigger clients with bigger prizes and candidates with far better resumes.  The result was a feeding frenzy.  Later seasons fostered business accumen like never before and aspiring starlets mugging for the camera.  The professionals devoured the latter.  Stacy J., for instance, was unfairly eliminated early and accused of lunacy for her vibrant, cheerleading sensibilities.  If the catclaws were apparent season one, they at least managed to put them away in time to win against the men!  Season two was bloody.  After season one the tasks were bigger but didn't showcase specific designated skills (like negotiating) for each week with each new task.  The later simulations often failed to surprise.  Later, it was harder to like the candidates.  Trump's admirable genuineness created, but later killed, the show.

I had a great time watching the first season via this DVD set. I have seen the last two seasons and loved them but I had never seen the first season. I thought I'd get this to see how it was and I wanted to see how the first winner was, (while being a candidate). I have to say that it was amazing. I loved the whole series. The candidates were very unique and entertaining to watch. Even Mr. Trump is a little more laid back in this season than others.

The bonus disk is also very fun. It has more info on the candidates, a music video, deleted scenes, career advice from Trump's advisors George and Carolyn, an exclusive sneak peak of season 2, "Donald-isms", unseen footage from the ending title taxi rides, new interviews with Donald Trump and the contestants, and creator Mark Burnett on The Apprentice. A lot to offer, really. 

I really recommend this set to those who like reality shows (like survivor). Even if you haven't seen the first season, or even if you haven't seen any of the seasons. This is really a great set.

I hope to see the second season on DVD soon.

I've had a lot of experience as a 'project manager' and it doesn't quite resemble the show's job description.  First and foremost this is a tv show where none of the women are overweight and are above average looking.  The men are allowed to be average looking.  Season one is by far the best. After that the show has just repeated itself and has not shown enough creative projects to keep it compelling.

The personalities are the stars.  Omorosa is not a capable worker but manages to inflate her abilities.  No wonder she couldn't keep a government job.  My sister saw the season finale with me but didn't see the other episodes.  She asked what was wrong with that woman.  So true, there's no way Omorosa should have a position with responsibility.  Lucily Amy is intelligent enough to keep the show from filling it with so so business women who are of course attractive.  Kwame and Bill could have easily won and would have done well at the job.  They didn't attack each others personalities, but tried to play up their strengths.  After the 1st season it became the 'street vendor show' and then the 'create a marketing campaign for a large company.'  By the second season many candidates were fired for the wrong reasons.  The 1st season had more logic behind the firings.

I didn't start watching The Apprentice until the second season. Now I am a big fan of the show, and I look forward to each new season. 

I bought the Season One DVD set awhile ago, and love it! I just wish that they would now release the rest of the seasons!

Trump gives great tips, that are highlighted during different times in the shows, and I always look forward to what he will say next. As successful as he is, he's definitely worth listening to!    

You might think that a reality show like this would get boring over time, but this one still manages to keep us watching...and loving it! Not only is The Apprentice entertaining, but you can learn a lot from the show.

I never watched the Apprentice when it was on TV.  I thought I wouldn't like it because I am not into business or Donald Trump.  But I ended-up checking it out from my library just to see what the big stink was about, and I was HOOKED!  I watched it all weekend, one episode after the other.  I had to know what happened!  I loved the challenges given to the contestants - it was fun to see how they would work through them.  Plus there is plenty of personal conflict and drama.  GREAT show

Frank Oz directs the best Steve Martin movies. While Michael Caine is a reliably excellent presence in most if not all of the movies he appears in, Martin (in my opinion) is uneven and all too often relies on shtick. Oz seems to bring out the best...or makes best use of the worse...in Martin's bag of tricks. Bowfinger is further evidence of this. We've (husband, wife and three kids) have seen this movie too many times to count and yet quite a few scenes never fail to make us laugh. The scene of Caine posing as famed Medical specialist testing Martin's feigned psychosomatic paralysis is priceless.

This one has it all - an inspired script (Lady Fanny of Omaha?) based on a clever premise, an opportunity for Steve Martin to work a full range of schticks (including a very earnest, "don't pity me, you don't have to do that" ruse), a richly-photographed Riviera backdrop and a stylish jazz violin score by the late Miles Goodman. Of special note is Michael Caine's wonderful man-about-town, a role that would have been tailor-made (pun intended) for the late David Niven and executed to perfection by Caine, who is at the top of his form here. Caine and Martin playing cat-and-mouse with one another is great fun. And, oh yes, there's that over-the-top segment about Ruprecht that a friend and I have bantered about for years.

Top-notch entertainment.

So many hysterical scenes that make everyone I watch it with laugh.  The ending is one that I can only aspire too, and I can't give it away!  However, I will say that watching con artists con eachother is on par with watching Josh Holloway trying to portray "Sawyer" his con-artist through the TV series Lost.  Enjoy

"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" is a classic comedy, driven from beginning to end by the crafty characters created by Michael Caine and Steve Martin.  

The storyline has been addressed extensively by other reviewers, but I will add that this film definitely breaks Mom's old rule: "don't make fun of the handicapped."  Not only are Martin and Caine's characters both morally handicapped in the extreme, but Martin gets to play not one but two handicapped characters as he works his cons: one is in a wheelchair, and the other (Ruprecht)....well, I don't know exactly what Ruprecht's handicap is, but  I can understand why he's kept locked up in his room.  

Finally, this movie has a lovely look to it, allowing you to take a fantasy trip to the French Riviera, stay in the finest hotels and villas, and sip the best champagne - that's a step up from most movies these days right there.  No explosions or violence.  Amazing.

For me, this film works because of Michael Caine.  It is his style and strong characterization as Lawrence Jamieson that holds the film together and allows Steve Martin to riff with his role as the crass Freddie Benson.  The film takes some chances and not everything works and some of it seems as if it belongs in another film, but part of the key to this film is to distract you so you don't really suspect what is happening until the end.

Glenne Headly is very nice as Janet Colgate, the object of a bet between the over confident con men.  Lawrence and Freddie are so sure of themselves that the loser is willing to leave town because each believes the other one is the loser.  However, Caine's character, Jamieson, begins to have pangs about treating such an innocent so callously.  Freddie, Steve Martin's more crass con man, has his own misgivings, as well.  

There are several really well done supporting roles, but the movie is really about these three and how Caine and Martin begin working together and end up competing.  One of the finest bits in the movie is when Caine is trying to teach Martin the social graces of a gentleman con man.  Frank Oz did a good job with this movie.  Some might say that he let too much of Martin's shtick into the movie, but I think it serves its important purpose of misdirection.  And much as Jim Carrey today, Martin was quite hot then and audiences had certain expectations for him.  And the bits are funny in a way that also induces a bit of queasiness, but funny nonetheless.

Watching the movie nowadays, while I still enjoy Martin's performance, I really enjoy Caine's more and notice Headly a bit more than I did the first time through

This is outright hilarious.  I admit I haven't seen the original version, but this one is fantastic.  It's choc full of witty and intelligent humour and it's well acted too.  Back in the day when I first saw this, I didn't see the ending coming.  Who would have guessed.  Without giving anything away, in a nutshell Steve Martin and Michael Caine compete to see who can swindle a set amount of dollars off a particular lady first.  It's a riot watching these two act out bizzare plots just to win the cash.  You must see this - you will be in stitches

Laurence Jameson (Caine) is a con-man, hustling rich corupt women out of thousands by lies and decept.  Freddy Benson is also a con-man, hustling your average everyday woman out of a meal or two here and there...but when the two of them end up in the same place at the same time they realize they have competition, and when Freddy realizes how much Laurence really makes off these women, well, he wants just as much.  The two decide to work together resulting in one of the funniest chain of events in movie history...whether Martin is playing Ruprecht (the monkey boy) or Officer Benson, the man crippled by memories of his fiance dancing naked with the host of Dance America, Martin is absolutly histarical.  Caine has a dry humor that works well when bouced off of Martins charisma.  I'm not a Caine fan but here he works well and casting can be forgiven since the script is tight and yes, Martin is brilliant.  Highly recomended...this will make you laugh out loud and Ruprecht will make you laugh so hard you will cry

Laurence Jamieson (Michael Caine) is a sophisticated confidence man that has be praying on the Riviera so long that he is even in the good graces of the local law enforcement. He crosses paths with an other "Dirty Rotten Scoundrel" Fred Benson (Steve Martin) who is more on the nickel and dime level.  After a fails attempt to shake Fred off Laurence decides to shape him up. Thy have to compete against the unknown predator only known as the jackal.

Can Fred learn the finer points of relieving people of their monetary endowment?

Or will everyone fall prey to the jackal?

They could not have picked better people for the parts as the actors seem to have put a lot of their own personalities into the roles.

I dont know what its like to have gone to school in the 1980's or have gone to school in the United States but I can still relate to this movie. This movie could have been set anywhere and in any decade and it would still tell the same story, only fashion and accessories would be different. Everyone has seen this movie by now and everyone has an opinion on it and most will say it is a really good movie. I would say that it deserves to be called a classic by now. It may not be a laugh out loud comedy or very dramatic and does move a little slow at times, but it delivers its message loud and clear and keeps you engaged throughout the whole movie. It gains momentum as it moves along and by the end, after experiencing all the emotiions you will feel satisfied.
Being a small cast, all your attention is focused on the individual characters. The 5 students are all completely different from one another and all are brilliant. Each actor plays their part perfectly. While there is a large age gap between them they are all convincing as teenagers fighting there own demons. They will all probably be most remembered for this movie, with the exception of Emilio Estevez, but special mention must go to Judd Nelson who I believe is the biggest star of the film. His part was originally intended for either Nicholas Cage or John Cusack who would have also been great, but I'm glad Judd got his chance to prove his acting capabilities.
It is a shame the DVD lacks many special features. All you get is a trailer and cast bios, I was desperately seeking an audio commentary, or at the very least production notes, however there are some interesting facts noted on IMDB. 
A teen movie for the 80's generation, anyone born after the film was made will probably not like it, but for others who grew up around or just after it will probably agree this movie is indeed a classic.
7.5/1

This movie is all about character development of people who are all drastically different.  This is a comming of age film for the 1980's.  The acting is wonderful.  It is a different style of movie.  There were some really great movies comming out then.  Ferris Beulers Day off, Pretty in Pink and some kind of wonderful.  This is another one.  It is a classic of the time period for the people comming of age durning this time.  The 1980's is a time I was fond of.  I do not find it tacky as the media is right now.  This movie is funny.  Some of these classics get refered to in  other movies.  You might want to watch it

Since "ER" debuted on NBC in 1994, it's taken the nation by storm.  It's wonderfully produced by author Michael Chricton,  a former surgeon before his writing career.  For numerous years, it was the #1 drama series on television.  The show starts with the cast of Anthony Edwards (Mark Greene), George Clooney (Doug Ross), Sherry Stringfield (Susan Lewis), Noah Wyle (John Carter), Julianna Margulies (Carol Hathaway), and Eriq La Salle (Peter Benton).  It has since won and been nominated for several awards including Emmys.  Its hospital action combined with personal drama always draws audiences deeply into every scene for every episode.  Its emergency scenes grown in intensity and drama through the episodes.

Season one introduces the everyday life in the ER in Chicago.  Throughout, it explores many critical issues including Hathaway's self-destruction that results in a suicide attempt, Carter struggling as a medical student, Ross living his sex obsessed life, and others.  Regular show viewers who haven't seen season one will see part of Lewis's reason for leaving Chicago in 1996, Greene in his first marriage and before Ella's birth (mother is Corday, who began in 1997), Deb Chin's (played by Ming Na) brief time in that ER as a medical student before returning as an official doctor in 2000, and many others.  Such combination shows partially how the show's theme evolved to today.  Episode by episode, the plot's quality stays on top.  The overall scenery, through the physical environment to the emotional drama, never fails to compile the unforgettable viewing experience.

Season two features the debuts of Gloria Reuben (Jeanie Boulet) and Laura Innes (Kerry Weaver, not an official cast member until season 3).  This season explores Ross's most heroic act as a doctor, Carter becoming a doctor, Lewis being forced to care for her neice, and many more.  Today's viewers who haven't seen season two will witness Boulet before testing positive for HIV, Weaver before realizing her lesbianism, Hathaway before her today's happy life (though now in Seattle), and others.  This plot evolves very well in quality from the previous season.  It continues its run of staying on top in critical care and drama.

Both seasons feature wonderful acting from the entire cast.  All add their own sense of individual theme into every scene.  Through personal struggles, drama, and continually saving lives, everyone gives the show its unique viewing flavor.

Such show quality makes "ER - The Complete First Two Seasons" worthy for all fans.  This is sure to please its audiences.  New viewers should watch these two seasons first.  Otherwise, the plot will be confusing.  Fans should watch for season 3 to be released on video in the near future

yes, I enjoyed The Crow City Of Angels much as I enjoyed the first and the third
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
The trio of The Crow films (yes, I enjoyed The Crow City Of Angels much as I enjoyed the first and the third) are unique by their own right, using brilliant cinematography to edge out the difference between them: The first, black and white homage to the graphic novels, with little pints of color; The second, sickly-greenish colors but somewhat interesting, as it shows us an ill-ridden type of a city much needing an angel guarding it; and the lively-yet-dark third movie, to show us real life tale of cruel justice gone bad.
In each tale, The Crow is adapted quickly to his poor circumstances and finds his strength in the one true link to his former love (In the second, its the one true pure soul left in the city, Sarah), and badder-than-ever villains. Brandon Lee's performance will become (if not already) legendary, and I refer to his DVD interview to emphasis its greatness ("because we do not know when we will die, we think of life as an inexhaustable well" will suffice with all the irony that goes along with it).
These three are classics, not to be confused with the fourth, which has less impact, since it tries too hard to be original, yet looses something along the way in terms of casting, acting, and cinematography, as the desert-themed atmosphere hasn't worked that well. Should have used more of that "grittier" feel to the scenes (like the four horsemen's introduction scenes), if you ask me. Having read Poppy Z. Brite's "The Crow: The Lazarus Heart", I found it more suitable for an on-screen adaptation, and thinking of it as taking The Crow in more nastier ways than ever before. But by using the first three films success in doing a B-rated sequels, it will take a miracle for these movies from becoming a laughing-stock

The first with Brandon Lee is a blast, as always.  I am not sure why everyone is so upset over the second one.  After all Eric and Shelly are refured to...by SARAH.  The second movie contiues with Sarah's story.  I dont know why, but most people miss that.  The third?  Well, I just got my set...and have not gotten to it yet.  But I expect it to be just as good

The first film is fantastic,and so are the others.I feel that their based on about a persons feelings of pain in life and it's effects on their emotions of their everyday lives that maybe a constant strugle even for victims of past abuse or trauma's.I mean that literly that when a person young or mid age watches these movies,I personly feel that they can strongly relate to such things within these movies.Weather their good or bad.Because honestly about these movies they somewhat have a true meaning and purpose in life as we know it,for the simple fact that some of the tragies in these movies could very well happen to us if you think honestly think about it.Even if it's just a movie.And, 
last,but not least the remarkable thing i like about this series
so much is when a important person dies,that they can be given
a 2nd chance at life by resurrection of the crow to do a rightful
deed of justice in return to go to heaven for destroying evil that was done to a innocent person or themselves.I BELIEVE IT'S A ACT OF FAITH..

The second and third films are basically garbage.
If THE CROW, directed by Proyas is the standard, then the rest are so far separated, that they fall into Oblivion.
The tale as played by Brandon Lee works on just so many levels, and is in my view , one of the best films about Justice for victims. I have a number of versions of the CROW on VHS and DVD, and the Extras on the triple pack fail in one respect; there is an interview with Lee on the VHS version that is without a doubt, one of the most poignant, touching, and eerily prescient interviews on tape. Lee talks about how we think it is all so limitless, and yet... how many times will we see the Moonrise, how many times will the things we love happen, in other words, the moments we have are precious... it is not that he was preaching some sort of live for the now moment, but that he wanted is to think about what it is that we have now , because if we do not realise what we have in the current moment, we may very well lose something extremely pure and vibrant. And just the loss ,the loss , or at least the change, of this one interview is enough to make an impact on the overall feel of the DVD.

However, the triple  pack is well worth it, if only to get the brilliant film, and to confirm that nothing holds a candle to the original THE CROW, and the sequels should never have been made... Lee's legacy should have been left as it was.
Lee is truly masterful in this film. Milking the franchise destroys Brandons Legacy

I splurged and treated myself to this set on my last birthday (Devil's Night.) I wanted to have all three films available should I feel the need to watch them again. The concept of supernatural justice has always appealed to me- it seems to be the only kind that really exists....

I wasn't dissappointed in this set. It contains all three of the "collectors series" versions, which means that they are packed full of special features. The profile of James O' Barr the creator of the original comic series was especially good. Plus, there is a special little booklet that gives an outline of the making of the films.

I really can't quite get the resentment of some people over the last two films. I mean, the original comics were about the reoccuring theme of different Crows and different injustices to be righted. Sure, the original film is by far the best, almost supernaturally superior, but the other two also manged to stay true to the vision.

The Crow- the first and obviously the best edition of The Crow series.Like many people say there was no other person destinied to play the role of Eric Draven better than Brandon Lee.Great action,excitement,and sadness any dark movie could ask for.With alot of great flash back scences to show the many faces of Draven.I give it 5/5 stars.
The Crow:City of angels- It always makes me mad about hearing everyone dislike this movie because it didnt live up to the hype of the original crow.Its got a whole different plot to it.Im glad they didnt have each movie based around the same plot,that would pretty much make anyothers after the original seem rather one dimensional.I thought it had a lot of good things in it,show that there's different types of love and not just for the whole bf/gf. I give it 4/5 stars.
The Crow:Salvation- in my opinion a really good movie in its own right.I mean it had alot of different things that the others were lacking,like mystery,we didnt know til near the very end of the movie,exactly who was behide the murders.With great acting by Jodi Lyne O'Keefe among others like Kirsten Dunst and Eric Mabius.The poor man being framed for the murder of his own girlfriend,his own death wasnt in vain because he came back from the dead to find the real criminals.I give it 4.5/5 stars.
Like I said each movie had things about them that made them different and very well producted in their own rights.I'd say to any movie buff,these 3 you'd get your money's worth. 4.8/5 stars for the box se

We're deep into the formula now with computer animated films -- and Over The Hedge is one of the most tired of the bunch. Can anyone say Buzz and Woody? Chicken Run? The Exterminator is the stock villain in CGI movies --almost identical to the vintage toy collector in Toy Story 2. How many times can you do the A-bomb joke...

Worse still is the dialogue, the painfully unfunny one-liners, and the 
see-saw animation that is either dull or like a pinball machine with sight gags and explosions. It is clear that each of these animators are trying to outdo one another, and that once again we see a cleverly-disguised lack of locations -- or interest. There must be nothing easier to craft and render than endless rows of geometric homes and a single proscenium of forest. This film is a by-the-numbers piece of merchandising with very little genuine artistry.

I found this film very entertaining! I loved the subtle pokes at suburbia and all the headaches that comes with it. Adults will enjoy the story as well as younsters. It's always fun to hear some of your favorite actors' voices in animated character form. But besides the fun, I feel this film had some good underlying lessons too. When we 'overindulge', we often cause ourselves trouble. One overindulgent racoon gets himself, and his friends, into a pickle by being greedy and self-serving. Will they be able to fix his mess, and more important, will they forgive him?

The story drags a bit in the beginning, but by the end, my wife and I ended up enjoying the movie quite a bit.  The voice acting was great all around (especially Shatner as a possum prone to playing possum) and the CGI animation is fine.  

Much of the movie seemed very familar - especially the set piece at the end which was lifted directly from the $300 episode of Futurama - but like they say, if you're going to steal, steal from the best.  Ben Folds music is another highpoint (stick around for his kid friendly rendition of Rockin' the Suburbs).

The extras are pretty good with highlights being extensive footage of the actors performing their lines, an additional cartoon featuring the original cast, and a sneak preview of Jerry Seinfeld's Bee Movie.  All in all, I recommend this to fans of animation

Considering I just saw Cars, I wasn't so sure about Over the Hedge.  I mean, Cars actually became one of my favorites after I finished it!  But I gave this a shot and I'm glad I did.  I'll admit, the whole concept of R.J. using the others to repay a debt wasn't very original, but the way it was executed made it very enjoyable.  Now I'm debating whether or not I want to buy it.  I'd say rent it first, but if you have kids, this is a good one for your collection

Yeah yeah yeah, it was intended to kids...but the movie is so well made that grown-ups like yours truly will thoroughly enjoy it. The movie has thought provoking satire of modern lifestyle (SUVs, pizza delivery, urban sprawl, strip malls, and the like)that grown ups can immediately relate to. 

A bonus feature on the DVD shows what technology and blend of art, physics, computing and psychology a film of this caliber takes. If you are outside the intended age group for this movie (read: kids) and have no kids, I just gave you a perfect excuse to justify this DVD! Overall, highly recommended.

For what you get in this DVD, the Amazon price ( current at the time of my writing) is fabulous value. The story runs the full range of emotions, and will touch the heart of kids, and Adults with good hearts, with the fun, joy and total adventure ride that the film encompasses. I am sure that everyone will support different  characters, and Hammy with his Caffeine power is just a wow of a performance.
They certainly did right by the consumer on this product

This is the best of the animated films that flooded the box office this summer.  Great voice talent, great storyline, and a highly enjoyable time at the movies.  The story pokes fun at our society and our excesses when a family of animals invade suburbia.  Dreamworks is giving Pixar a run for their money.

After about 10 weeks of intensive dance lessons or a season of cheer practice your child should be easily able to perform the first five minutes of the "warm up".  Otherwise, they will be very frustrated. It is very fast, very complicated.  Well Choregraphed but even the "break it down" segment moves at double speed.

I wish I had read the other reviews before I purchase this DVD.  It is obvious that a profession choreographer was not involved in the making of this product at all.  You are shown too many moves at once and they are shown to you very quickly.  Even the "break down" section of the DVD is impossible to follow.  VERY Disappointing

This is the first of two Hardy Boys serials that originally appeared in "The Mickey Mouse Club".  You will not get "The Mickey Mouse Club" on this DVD, just The Hardy Boys segments.  In the mid 1990's the Disney Channel (cable tv) removed some of the MMC serials from the shows and created new half-hour shows of just those stories.  New opening &amp; closing titles were created for these new mini-series.

The then-famous song "Gold Doubloons &amp; Pieces of Eight" introduces you to "The Mystery Of Applegate's Treasure".  A serialized story loosely based on the first Hardy Boys book "The Tower Treasure".

Starring:
Tim Considine (of Spin &amp; Marty fame) as Frank Hardy.
Tommy Kirk (Old Yeller &amp; The Shaggy Dog) as Joe Hardy.

Purists will be disappointed that they are not getting the complete, unedited, hour-long "Mickey Mouse Club" shows that these ran in, but fans will still enjoy these re-edited episodes

I saw this cinematic masterpiece with my French class, and we were amazed and utterly captivated by the lush story of French teenaged despair. We felt close to Vic, as we could identify with her trauma and her crush on Mattieu. Vic's parents seemed similar to my French class' parents, and so did Vic's school, with its social hierarchy and innocent parties. I feel that "La Boum" truly makes a substantial effort to bridge the cultural gap in between American teenagers and their French peers. This effort is successful in my opinion, as our class found that we were laughing with Vic, crying with her, and screaming with her at her frustrating parents. We lived through "La Boum" in the shoes of a completely foreign and strange girl, and found that we weren't that much different, after all. "La Boum" made an impact on us more than "Goodburger" or "Totoro" ever could.

For those who grew up watching the "American Pie" movies, the "La Boum" films must seem silly, harmless and bland.  If you expect to see a lot of nudity and hear a lot of raunchy jokes, don't bother with this movie.  If you want some harmless family fun and some conversational French practice - rent or buy "La Boum"

 I watched both parts of "La Boum" for the first time when I was about 12 years old. You can imagine how surprised I was when I found this movie on this website. This movie will definitely be appreciated by those who like French language, French cinematography and Sophie Morceau. It's a great listening practice. I don't want to go into details: if you want to know what it's about - watch it. It was made in 80s, and it makes it even more interesting

Cruel Intentions has been slammed by critics, who have unfairly and unfavourably compared it with 1989's Dangerous Liaisons (both films stem from Choderlos de Laclos's novel, Les Liaisons Dangereuses). Whereas Dangerous Liaisons is fairly faithful to the original, Cruel Intentions manipulates the plot - throwing a twist in the tail - and relocates the milieu from 18th century France to the present-day Upper East Side of New York, where underneath the veneer of respectability, wealthy teenagers plot each other's downfalls. 

Stepsiblings Kathryn Merteuil and Sebastian Valmont are two such teenagers. They amuse themselves by arranging reputation-destroying paybacks for those who have wronged them, and make wagers on the outcome. The focus of the movie is Sebastian's attempt to make a conquest of the Headmaster's virginal daughter, Annette (who, in a heavy-handed attempt at symbolism, wears white throughout almost the entire film).

However, the movie certainly has some memorable high points, beginning at the very outset where the camera swoops fast and low over what appears to be a grassy park studded with rocks; only after the camera angles away does the viewer realise - with some discomfort - that the park is in fact a graveyard. The opening scenes also introduce the appealing and well-judged soundtrack, which includes artists as diverse as Placebo and Fatboy Slim. The Verve's song, Bittersweet Symphony, is an absolutely perfect 'just desserts' track at the film's conclusion.

These kids are incredibly nasty and vindictive, but owing to the verbosity of the script and the almost total lack of adult chaperones appearing on screen, it is difficult at times to remember that they are only teenagers. In the end though, perhaps we just like to see someone be very, very wicked and almost get away with it

This movie was so amazing and I was extremely attracted to the theme.  The story involves alot of seduction and betrayal.  I call that the perfect mix for a teen movie.  I am a teenager myself, and I found it to be quite interesting.  The cast was great, and I think that made the movie even better.  It was a movie involvong every type of character, the good girl, the evil whore, and to top it off, one guy for both girls.  I would reccomend seeing it, but watch out because the content is a little intense sometimes.  I hope you see it and enjoy

This modern day addaptation of Dangerous Liasons took us to another level with the heartless, calculated antics of teenagers.  While this was panned by critics, it spoke to something in the audience in it's sociopathic tendencies.

Sarah Michelle Geller plays Kathryn, the student body president of an elitist New York boarding school and step sister of Ryan Phillipe, the big man on campus whose charms hide a sinister skirt chaser.  She makes a bet with him that he will not be able to bed Reese Witherspoon, who has proclaimed her intensions to remain a virgin until marriage.  Should he succeed, he can have Kathryn.  If he fails, Kathryn can have his car.

Perhaps critics were astounded that kids can really be this cruel, but maybe they forgot what it was like to be a kid themselves.  Just listen to the gossip and heartless talk of teenagers and you will know what I mean.  Ryan Phillipe is every girl's dream come true and worst nightmare.  While he uses his good looks and charms to get as many women in his bed as he can, he will post nude photos of them on the Internet and pat himself on the back as a stud.  Give him a challenge, such as Reese Witherspoon, and he has to work hard for it.  While he is truly a cad, he does in the end feel love for Reese because he had to work for her affections.  Kathryn gets the greatest satisfaction of saying no, as she knows that he is truly hurt to have ended the affair when they did nothing but take joy in toying with emotions.  Listen to a few locker room conversations and chats in the homeroom, that's what it's all about.  

As the viewer, you can't help but take perverse pleasure in their plotting and watching others fall victim to their schemes.  How about that scene when Kathryn says she puts her trust in Jesus and unscrews the cross to reveil her coke spoon?  That's classic.  If anything it teaches you to not fall for others' fronts.  So girls, be careful of who seems so sincere.  And boys, don't be so cruel

In the late 1990's something happened. Two movies came out. Neither was particularly well reviewed (although a few respected critics did give them good reviews) but despite all the negativity the two films became cult hits and  are still referenced to today in movies all the time. These two movies were
"Wild Things" and "Cruel Intentions". While "Wild Things" featured an elaborate plot, all-star cast, great sex scenes; "Cruel Intentions" plot is simple, has a cast of then up-and-comers, and has no nudity at all.
Both of these movies scored with the MTV crowd and while you can find both films in the 5 dollar bin at Wal-Mart, everyone remembers them. Also, both of these movies are just mindless fun; You're attention span doesn't have to be large and the people involved in both movies weren't trying to make classic films that would win Oscars and great acclaim, which in the long run attracted many critics and audiences to these movies. While I think Wild Things is a better movie, this film did keep me entertained for 94 minutes. Anyway, Ryan Phillippe plays Sebastian Valmont. Sebastian is a spoiled rich kid, who happens to be incredibly charming and takes pleasure in having sex with young women and destroying their lives. Everyone knows what Sebastian is like, and he loves it. His step-sister Kathryn is pretty much the same, except she basks in the role of the "good-girl", she's even student body president of the school they attend. One day, Kathryn tells Sebastian how a guy named Court has dumped her and fallen for a young idiot girl named Cecile (Selma Blair) and she wants Sebastian's help to destroy the young girl's life. Sebastian has found something a bit more interesting...The new headmaster's daughter Annette (Reese Witherspoon). Annette is a virgin, who plans to stay that way and Sebastian sees a challenge. So, Kathryn proposes a wager. If Sebastian succeeds in deflowering Annette, he will get the thing he's been longing for, for years. He'll get to bed Kathryn. If he loses, Kathryn gets his most prized possession...His car. Pit of a perverted plot yes and it comes together in funny, sometimes even stupid ways. But, as I said earlier for mindless entertainment it's dead on. As for the performances, Gellar is great as the sadistic little nice girl. With Phillippe, however, I couldn't tell if his acting was bad or if that's how Sebastian would act. Blair captures the innocent, unwitting virgin girl quality perfectly.  She's so good in fact, she almost seems to be a virgin. Witherspoon (obviously, since she's the only person in this film to go and win anything) in really the strongpoint of the film. At this point in her career she really had the cute innocent girl face and qualities, and there's a few scenes in the movie where the "face" thing I mentioned is clearly there; but she's playing a different virgin girl from Blair. Witherspoon is playing the knowing, smart, want to wait for love girl. So, this movie is really not for everybody as you may have figured out by now. But if you're at the video store and just need 90 minutes of entertainment and fun, go for it. 

GRADE: B

I'll start off by saying that this movie had a lot of promise in the beginning. The dialogue (especially a lot of Sebastion's lines) was really witty and smart. 
But somewhere near the climax, the movie turned into another sappy teen romance movie. That really disappointed me. I was hoping for something a little more than that. And (SPOILER) what also really disappointed me about this movie was when Annette lost her virginity. Her character changed so fast that it was unbelievable! It would have been more interesting if she had stayed a virgin

I'm glad this is finally available on DVD - I've just about worn out my old VHS version of it.  On this DVD you get an introduction by Kathy, followed by a warm-up routine.  This is composed of some light aerobics and stretching.  Then you get five different ab workouts, one for each day of the week.  They each last about 10 - 12 minutes (I never actually timed them, but it seems like they get progressively longer from the first to the last).  Each workout consists of approximately five different exercises, though there may be two or three variations on an exercise, so there's quite a bit of variety.  Areas targeted are upper and lower abs and obliques (the muscles along the sides of the abs).  The Monday workout is fairly easy and shouldn't present a problem for any but the most out-of-shape individuals.  Tuesday's workout is only slightly harder.  By the time you get to Wednesday and Thursday, they start getting rather challenging.  To get through these you'll need to be in fairly descent shape.  Friday is the really difficult one, I'd say a person would have to be in excellent shape to complete it.

Of course, you can just stop and take a short rest if the exercises get to hard for you, then join back in.  It took me about six weeks before I was able to complete the Friday workout all the way through without taking a few little breaks.  I like to use this video as a warm-up before my weight lifting workout.  

Kathy does the workout along with 5 other people.  The music is unobtrusive synth-pop type stuff with a little funk edge to it.  You'll need a bench (or chair) and some dumbells (only used on two exercises, you could use some other object if you don't have dumbells).

I'd recommend this tape for the moderately fit individual looking to get into even better shape.  You'll definitely get a six-pack from doing these workouts, provided that your body fat percentage is low enough that you can see your abs

This movie is hilarious, and it also delivers powerful truths about the workplace.  My favorite scene is Doralee's--Dolly Parton's character's--fantasy about killing the rotten boss.  This is Dolly's first movie, and she is a natural.  Everyone in this film does a superb job.  Made in 1980, but timeless

Jane Fonda is best taken on screen in small doses, and the presence of the ace funny girl Lily Tomlin and the sexpot-on-the-outside, good-girl inside Dolly Parton in supporting roles help this project immensely. My favorite actor in this one, however, is Dabney Coleman as the evil boss. There are a few excesses, including a marijuana scene which rings false
 for this trio of co-workers, but the overall experience is just good fun for a couple of hours.

Lilly Tomlin is hysterical in this movie. She makes this movie. It' fun, and your rooting for the women all the way. One specific part is not for the kids. My kids were bored with it. But I enjoyed it from the release date and it's still entertaining

Brilliant.Although the film has aged,it's still just as funny all these years later.This is a must for anyone who has ever had thoughts of getting revenge on a boss.The documentary afterwards is great as it offers a lookat how the three girls ended up filming it together.10/10 even after 25 years

FIRST THOUGHTS - -   

This movie is among the greatest 100 minute entertainment fests in existence. "9 to 5" reaches and touches everybody, both male and female somewhere personal and strangely satisfying. Though the plot is great and really moves, it is the smart "fantasy-revenge" ideas, dialogue and strong characterizations that keep this from becoming mean-spirited and thereby enable this movie to work so well for a diverse audience. 

We need to salute Director/Screenwriter, Colin Higgins first. Higgins was the Screenwriter for "Harold and Maude", "Silver Streak" and "Foul Play", picking up a Golden Globe nomination for "Foul Play" in 1978. All of Higgins films have an air of sophistication and display a refreshing respect for the audience particularly in avoiding the obvious mean-spirited cliches that many of his films' topics' encompass. Also, Editor Pembroke J. Herring who was nominated for 3 Academy Awards for Editing and also edited "Ground Hogs Day", did an amazingly seamless job of keeping "9 to 5" so coherently glued together. Herring was nominated for "Best Editing" for; "Tora! Tora!Tora!", 1970, "Bound For Glory",1976, "Out Of Africa", 1985 and edited many other excellent comedies and dramas. Higgins and Herring worked together on a number films all of which turned out the better for their contribution and "9 to 5" is one of them. 

The three female leads all embody some type of stereotype. Lily Tomlin, as Violet Newstead is the widow with four children, going it alone and trying to break into the male dominated executive world of big business for the past 12 years - UNSUCCESSFULLY. She is confident and capable but she is a woman in a man's world, so she is very dissatisfied with the treatment she has been getting by the male establishment embodied through F. Hart [Dabney Coleman]. Jane Fonda, as Judy Bernly, is in the middle of a divorce in which her no-good husband, Dick, played deftly by Lawrence Pressman, left her for his secretary. Judy is now entering the workforce unprepared and for the first time and especially unprepared for the living embodiment himself, F.Hart. Dolly Parton as the delightful Doralee Rhodes, who F.hart chases round and round the office and even tries getting to conventions that do not exist all for a good time - HIS, examplifies how office rumors can ruin peoples' reputations and of course by the living embodiment himself. That's F.Hart of course and he is the bane of these three "innocent women" and as we see, represents most everything that is wrong in their lives as they see it. BTW, Dolly Parton in this role was nominated for an "Oscar", "Best Song", and 3 "Golden Globes", includeing "Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy". 

This film could not get off the ground without a worthy adversary to these very potent femme fatales in training. Dabney Coleman as Franklin Hart or just F.HART, delivers an oscar worthy effort in his role as the living embodiment of almost every rotten thing a man in charge can do to women under him at the office. He is "his" 3 "GIRLS" reason for being the way they are, at least throughout the film. Coleman very generously lends himself to the same type of role Carrol O'Connor did in "All In The Family" as a means of illustrating that some things are clearly and obviously wrong and need to be changed. Comedy and Cliches are powerful tools for evoking awareness and change and "9 to 5" serves that cause well, chiefly through the utterly despicable nature of Coleman's character. Man or woman, we all enjoy Coleman's comeupance and so will you. 

My favorite scenes are the three completely different fantasies our heroines relay to each other while under the influence of marijuana. Naturally, these flights of fancy all involved some overdue and elaborate revenge against F.Hart. Even such animated Disney characters as "Snow White" make an appearance in Tomlin's depiction of Hart's demise. Naturally, the reality nearly repeats Tomlin's fantasy on the very next day, which leads our heroines to stealing a corpse, evading the police, kidnapping and much, much more. 

The scenes and gags in this film all further the plot and just dove-tail so nicely and so entertainingly together that it is over all to soon. We are left wanting more without realizing we have just sat for over 100 minutes and the issues and conflicts motivating the characters and fueling the film's plot have been resolved. 

This is a terrific black comedy. Our characters [3 female leads] gain our empathy as they enter into a kind of twilight zone where both their personal survival and convictions stretch these women and allow their characters to show what they are made of and achieve both personal growth and unexpected satisfaction. Their foil, F.HART after showing all how despicable he was, literally plunges into the abyss as if sent to purgatory and then hell for his misdeeds against women as the plot unfolds. "REEL JUSTICE", tidy and quick!! The topic and the settings have aged very well and even after a quarter century this film in no way seems dated. 

--* THE CAST --* Colin Higgins  - Director / Screenwriter

Lily Tomlin  - Violet Newstead 
Dolly Parton  - Doralee Rhodes

 --* THE AWARDS --*

Best Song (nom)  Dolly Parton  1980  Academy  
 Best Actress- Musical or Comedy (nom)  Dolly Parton  1980  Golden Globe  
 Best Original Song (nom)  Dolly Parton  1980  Golden Globe  
 New Star of the Year - Female (nom)  Dolly Parton  1980  Golden Globe  


DVD FEATURES: 

It is widescreen [1.85:1] and much clearer than the VHS release. The Disney characters in Violet's fantasy demonstrate this obvious color and clarity improvement over the video release. It has 1 trailer and of course scene selection and is available on the same DVD in either English or French with English or Spanish subtitles or no subtitles at all [of course]. Naturally, some interviews and a neat featurette would be nice but again this is a large improvement over the old faded video releases. 

FINAL THOUGHTS - - This wonderful film is highly recommended and "9 to 5s" entertainment value stands up very well to repeated viewings and the passage of 26 years.

This review is for the 2001 DVD release.
  Have you ever daydreamed about what you would like to do to your boss who was too hard on you or did something to you objectionable?
  Well, these secretaries did.  They carried out a plan against their boss and got away with it.
  Please keep in mind, this film is a comedy and was made to laugh at.
  However, their are some strong messages here that can be well learned.  Bosses should not verbally abuse and/or sexually intent, touch, harass any employee.  This film does point out employees have rights too.  Managers can be in the wrong too.
 Jane Fonda is "Judy Bernly".  Recently divorced.  Has no experience, but is a very decent woman.  Today is her first day at Consolidated Companies LTD.  On her first day everything goes wrong.
  Lily Tomlin is "Violet Newstead".  She has worked their forever.  Never spies.  She is ready for a promotion. She trains Judy on her first day.  In fact, Violet has trained most of the people there and they have been promoted instead of her.
  Dolly Parton (in her first film) is "Doralee Rhodes".  Mr. Hart's main secretary.  There is bad gossip going around about the boss and the secretary, but it is not true.  Doralee is a married woman  and is a Christian and pure as Judy is and would never engage in bad behavior at work.
  Dabney Coleman is the boss, "Franklin Hart". He is the boss and the vice-president.  Has has a bad mouth towards secretaries and wants "personal servitude" that is not part of the job description.
  After the boss makes personal advances towards Doralee, makes inappropriate comments towards Violet and dismisses Maria (Roxanna Bonilla-Giannini) for having light conversation in the bathroom and guessing the bosses salary, and after another incident, Violet, along with Doralee and Judy later decide that something has to be done to the boss and improvements must be made within the company.
  Better working conditions for all.  Violet just might get her promotion yet.
Also in the cast: Elizabeth Wilson, Peggy Pope, Sterling Hayden, Lawrence Pressman, Marian Mercer.
  Yes, that is Dolly Parton singing "Nine To Five".

 Jane Fonda and Dabney Coleman also worked together in On Golden Pond (1981).
  Followed by the tv series Nine To Five (1982-83) with Rita Moreno as "Violet", Valerie Curtin as "Judy", and Rachel Dennison as "Doralee".  Jane Fonda was one of the Producers and Executive Producers.  Rachel Dennison is Dolly Parton's real-life sister.
  Update: As of April 2006, the cast reunited to celebrate the 2006 DVD release.  According to Jane Fonda on "Larry King Live", they are in "talks" of a sequel

However, did anyone else notice how 25 years later, Dabney Coleman is referring to Tomlin, Fonda and Parton as "gals" and "girls" in the 9 to 5 at 25 featurette? Made me wonder....

This movie may be unfamiliar to American viewers, who watch american movies only. But this is a very humorous movie, starring some of Russia's best comedians - Yuri Nikulin and Andrei Mironov.
In Bulgaria, they used to show it on every New Year's day.

The plot is like this: A russian turist (Nikulin) in Istanbul slips and falls and says "Chort Poberi" (which means something like "damn", or "hell", or "go to the devil" in russian language.)
This happens to be a password for some bandits, who await their man (Mironov) to smuggle diamonds in the cast of his would-be broken arm. Without realizing what is happening, Nikulin's character smuggles the diamonds. Then he has encounters both with the russian police and with the bandits. And there is a happy end...

Watch this film, I'm sure you will enjoy it. In Bulgaria, you can legally buy it on a DVD for just $2

An hilarious movie about mistaken identity, the Russian mafia, the KGB and an unsuspecting nice guy in the middle of it all!

Nikulin is hilarious as usual, and what can you say about the peerless Mironov?

I watched this movie back in St.P some 14 years ago, and even when my Russian was just in the basic stage I could still follow it. Once my Russian progressed, I grasped all the very funny word play and situational humour.

If you like enjoying yourself - buy this movie

I have read one negative review about this film and I would like to clarify the statements made in it. I am Russian so, obviously, I like this film. It has typical Russian humor, it is a farce, so do not look for higher meanings in the jokes, it makes fun of the social standards of the Soviet regime as well as the people who served it so well. It features some of the best Russian actors that we love seeing and acting; they sing in the movie and it is lovely as well. If you are a tough judge of movies, then please make sure you know Soviet history a bit and understand that the humor differs from what you see in American movies before you call it crap. 
I do not see why there should be a problem with characters not talking for the first ten minutes of the movie. In fact, it is just a few minutes during which you are shown the premise of the movie. And as for cyrillic letters not making sense: this is a Russian movie and you are bound to see everything written in our gibberish alphabet. Besides, the movie begins with a cruise in a foreign country (it was shot in Baku, Azerbajan but is supposed to be Turkey). The language spoken by the locals as well as the signs on buildings are gibberish - it was made up specially for the movie.

That said, I want to say a few words about the plot. Semen Semenovich is a diligent Russian economist goes on a cruise, where he gets acquainted with a mafia mob's right hand, Kozodoev, whose assignment is to pick up diamonds from the supplier and deliver it back to Moscow via a cast on his arm. During one of the last stops, Semen Semenovich gets mistaken for Kozodoev and ends up with a cast and jewels inside it. As he returns to Moscow, Semen contacts the police. Now, he has to pose as bait and escape the traps elaborately planted by the mafia.

As I already said, the movie is fantastic. Just remember that it is a farce. And no, there is not slapstick humour. Be open-minded and enjoy! Oh, and by the way, all the jewelry you will see on the screen is authentic. It's mentioned in the beginning that the film crew would like to thank all Soviet individuals who lend their gems for the filming.

This is a typical (semi slapstick) Gaiday film. It is corny, well produced, and will please anyone who enjoys the upper crust of silly comedy. The subtitles are just fine. You do not have to understand any Russian to laugh at this movie. Buy it, and enjoy

WOW! This brought back so many memories for me. I was shocked when a friend of mine gave me this DVD as a Christmas present because I'm the ultimate Old-School head. And to my surprise (and his) I'm in it! As the DVD plays, there are seemingly a hundred still shots of "jams" and "crew pictures" being faded in and out that give you a glimpse of our attitudes and fashions of the time. If you were there, you may spot some of your peeps. This is one of the most accurate DVDs chronicling the birth of Hip-hop, when it wasn't about the money &amp; bling. The "artists" interviewed are telling the real story. A must have for all the aspiring DJ's, MC's, and dancers of today

It amazes me how something like B-boyin' that is so inventive, exhilerating, and positive could have only been in the mainstream media for less than 2 years (circa 1983-1985) but a fad like being a gangster (that is so negative), has been in the mainstream media for nearly 15 years! (NWA introduced it in the late 80's. It's sad to see that Hip Hop has turned into the very thing that it swore to diminish.

I am a 'professional' female in my 30's, and remember and love breakdancing. I am soooo glad I bought this DVD which I plan on giving to my son for his birthday. But now the DVD will be OURS! What's great about it is that it shows the old 70's/early 80's b-boying stars &amp; clips and then talks to the same people all grown up in their 30's/40's today. You WILL watch this over and over! Great history and roots of this NYC, then West Coast phenomenon...If only today's Hip Hop &amp; Rap were as fun and clean as breakdancing was..

This DVD totally covers pretty much everything you should know about the B-boy and B-boy culture.  As far as how it started, to where it stands today.  The interviews are raw, and to the point.  From the footage of the early days, to the present, is very well put together. It just, all flows.  Very fresh.  Also the special features isn't just a bunch of crap, which usually gets put on DVD's.  This DVD is way worth the price, and well wicked.  Buy It!  peace

Ouzon explores the feminine universe through the lives and times of 8 women around the sudden crime of the only man of the house. 8 women, every one of them with their affective lacks, their tribulations. Little miseries, sorrows and disillusions. Each one oft them is potentially suspicious of having murdered Marcel.

The admirable photography and colossal arrangement of a beautiful stage, with a sublime red carpet that remind us Bergman in Cries and whispers plus the visible and well deserved homage top Alfred Hitchcock (Vertigo) expressed warmly in the last quarter of the film, plus the additional musical numbers make of this film an absolute and delicious feast to your senses.   

A must-see!

A previous reviewer challanged the lack of normative values, however, even though there are elements of the risque in the film, the director chose to be reserved and to let the actors and ultimately the audience decide for themselves what they think about it all.

I thought that the plot, the scenery, the songs and everything else was all great.  It is a French musical whodunnit but one that doesn't take itsself too seriously.  Whoever wrote the bad review shouldn't take it so seriously either (besides, it's ridiculous to rip on a countries birthrate as if it is part of the artistic value of a movie, so he should have ranted somewhere a bit more appropriate.)

My favorite characters were played by Denouve and Huppert (both of whom are amazing actresses in their own rights) and all of the twists and turns kept me entertained, even though a bit of suspension of disbelief is required.  Then again, it is a musical, so disbelief should be left at the door

Terrible direction, terrible writing, it almost feels like the director didn't know what he was working with. Although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie CLUE, it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid. It was a total watse of good celluloid

The total absence of normative values makes for tedium, and revulsion, not for greatness.

Nor even, for that matter, for titillation.

When even father/daughter incest is treated as a matter of callous indifference, it becomes easy to see why the French are exterminating themselves, by refusing to reproduce themselves. At the fertility rate of 1.4 children per family, the French nation will be gone in another few generations. This movie will help the viewer see why.

Sociologically and philosphically interesting, in that it epitomizes the banality of evil, and demonstrates the futility of putting lipstick on a pig. Secularism is devoid of soul, and offers nothing to live for, nothing to live by.

This is the first movie I have seen whose rating slipped further the longer it played. 

"Eight Women" is the story of, well, eight women, who are trapped by a snowstorm -- all 5 inches of it. The man of the house has been murdered in the night. Young and old, black and white, of different classes, the women must try to determine who the killer is. "Eight Women" is also a movie about secrets, of which everyone seems to have several. The plot has more twists and turns than an Alpine road on the Tour de France. Yet the first 2/3 of the film is tolerable, funny and even a bit interesting. The characters are self-interested and fun. There's dotty old grandma, a prissy, hysterical virgin aunt, the dead man's vampish sister and coltish young maid, two daughters, a somber yet elegant wife (Catherine Deneuve) and a black cook. Plenty of class and age tension to make three movies.

Did I mention the music? Every twenty minutes or so, one of the characters breaks into song. These are always those stereotypical French songs -- full of longing and sadness and references to sleep and springtime -- that are tedious to American ears. And bizarre. While one character sings, the rest do slow little dances. Strange.

By the 2/3 mark, I was going to give this quirky film 4 stars. But soon, the plot line spun out of control, getting more and more manic until it finally derailed completely with a tragic ending. Definitely not recommended unless you are desperate need of a bizarre experience.

Having stumbled onto this film being played on TV late last night and given that Emmanuelle Beart was in this, I was immediately hooked into watching it. As has been mentioned it does feature a stellar cast from l'histoire du cinema francais. Deneuve, Beart, Fanny Ardant, Isabelle Huppert......the list goes on. And being that the story revolves around these 8 women ( yes I know but there was really no other way of putting it ), it keeps you locked in.

What I found fascinating were the songs. Now normally I hate musicals or films where they seem to break into song practically at random ( think Rocky Horror Picture Show ) but this I can tolerate. The songs are so poetic and indeed high in camp factor but it's fun to look at the choreography behind the songs. It's almost like every actor had to study the choreography of their song in detail right down to having tears welling up in their eyes. Which is pure brilliance. Even if you don't like French pop songs you can still laugh at how they got their choreographed movements to perfection as if you were watching a pop video which, when it breaks into a song, is exactly what it becomes!

The basic plot of the film is really just a family find that the only man of the house is dead. So whodunnit? This leads to questions over betrayal, family secrets and the web of lies that has been spun by each and every member of the family. Now a film like this might bore you really but what keeps it alive other than the songs is the chemistry between each and everyone of the actresses. There seems to be no such problems over ego and each play their part competently and seem to take on their character to the point where the character becomes them. Which is the sign of great actors pulling together as a team to create a great movie. No ifs, no ands, no buts! Oh and if you are not moved by the last song that is played in this film, I will be amazed as it is so beautiful in its truthfulness that it makes me want to hear it again and maybe even cry. It's that good!

Just simply superb. There's nothing else to add

This farcical "who done it" is funny, absurd, campish, and silly all at the same time.  Starring a kind of premiere selection of leading ladies of the French cinema, 8 femmes reminds me of similar tongue-in-cheek "who done its" such as Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians and especially Neil Simon's Murder by Death.

Adapted from the play by Robert Thomas, which accounts for the stage play feel to the production, this one begins--as a proper murder mystery might--with a murder in a well-appointed house out in the country.  Somehow everyone is stranded there and of course under suspicion.  While Neil Simon made fun of detectives in Murder by Death, and Agatha Christie made fun of murder, period, here the fun is on the players themselves. What follows, as all point fingers away from themselves, is a whole lot of dirty laundry and closet skeletons being tossed about.

The scandalous revelations, including interracial lesbianism, same- and heterosexual incest, etc., are particularly ironic since the film is set in the staid fifties.  (Note Suzon's pink/orange pony skirt.)  To quote a line from the film, "it's a sad family affair" played for laughs with a kind of absurdist delight.  Yet, there is no nudity or anything resembling sexual titillation anywhere in the film.  Strange.

In another sense this is a celebration of some of the French cinema's leading ladies who get to strut their stuff and play it for laughs.

Catherine Deneuve heads the cast as Gaby the wife of the murdered.  She looks stately, beautiful and more than a bit spoiled.  Danielle Darrieux at 85 steals a few scenes as the mother, Mamy.  Isabelle Huppert makes herself into a neurotic, dotty old maid named Augustine while Emmanuelle Beart plays Louise, the sexy maid.  Fanny Ardant is Pierrette, Gaby's scandalous sister-in-law.  The cast takes turns doing lightweight song and dance numbers which tends to fluff out the production in a sweet fifties-ish way.  In a kind of gender joke, no men appear in the movie, although we do see the back of Marcel (Gaby's husband) a couple of times.

You will not be able to guess who done it, but I will not tell you why.

See this for Danielle Darrieux, one the grande dames of the French cinema whose film credits go back to 1931--yes, 1931.  She has a lot of fun in a juicy part

Yes, this murder mystery is twisted and dark, but also wonderful to watch.  All the characters (with the possible exception of the father) are so intriguing and bizarre...and they tend to break out into song at the drop of a hat.  What a nasty family, but one can't help being sucked into their vicious yet humorous little spats and heated debates.  They put the fun in the word dysfunctional, without a doubt.  Beyond the wonderful characters is the beautiful scenery.  True that it is primarily shot indoors, but the colors are stunningly vivid and bright.  Maybe it is in contrast to the darkness of the plot, I don't know, but it is certainly a feast for the eyes.  The story itself is pretty good, and not difficult to follow, but the interactions between these outstanding characters are absolutely priceless and make this movie one you should not miss.

Wall Street, the movie starring Michael Douglas is lame compared with this docutainment.  Whereas the first offering is fictitious, the latter is Enron, a global brand that's since become a verb and even becoming skits in the Simpsons!  How would a company that started out humbly would grow so fast so big in a few years would then taking record breaking speed to go bankrupt and then ruining the livelihood of so many ordinary people and that it puts the Bush family in an awkward situation for being overfriendly with Ken Lay, the founder of Enron in the early days?  This docutainment could have been a dry &amp; boring subject and yet, it's captivating to view.  The authors believed that what made Enron so enticing to the public mass is its human tragedy aspect.  Brilliant people who would be so blinded by their own arrogance, pride, narcissim, brilliance, greed that they would do something so stupid for digging a hole so big and so deep that they couldn't get themselves out of it.  This docutainment is the story about Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, the fall guy, Falstow (the CFO) who would be left to hang to dry and their doings that would have such a detrimental impact on so many people.  It's outrageous to hear the tape recording of Enron traders of bragging the money that they were making at expense of California power crisis.  Somehow, human tragedy of such epic proportion shall repeat itself again someday because we humans don't seem to learn from mistakes.  An intriguing documentary that needs to be seen to be believed

Because the Enron scandal has become one of the biggest securities frauds in American history, this documentary sums up - in a nice little package - how organized and white-collar crimes are costly to society in both human and financial terms.  More importantly, this documentary shows how the American criminal justice system responds to criminal careers of corporations.  As a result of the aforementioned, I use this audio-visual as a teaching tool in my criminology class and highly recommend it to professors and students alike.

The documentary Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room had a bit of a rough start. Although intriguing, it failed to deliver the rough sketch of the Enron scandal quick enough. I'll shamefully admit that I had forgotten most of the details of the Enron scandal, as I was in college when it broke and I didn't care too much about it at the time. But, once the overall story had been discussed, this documentary did a fairly good job of telling a compelling narrative and trying to explain the rather complicated financial wizardry that was ultimately the corporation's downfall. The depictions of Skilling were very clear and it was nice to see a woman was at the heart of breaking the story and writing the movie (which was based on a book she co-wrote). Amusing use of music and title-cards kept the pace quick, and unlike Michael Moore's documentaries, this one was actually full of well presented facts. I'd definitely recommend seeing this movie, especially because it reveals yet another reason to hate W and his administration. I wish more people were interested in this kind of reporting and that our day-to-day media was this intellectually engaging

The news did not really give justice to what was really happening with Enron during that time.  Why it fell.  How some people wondered why they did not have data like a normal company.  This movie is just wonderful.  It shows how they made a total joke of the American Stock Market and got away with it.  Power outages in California were actually intentional by Enron.  The story goes on obviously after the movie has been filmed.  With that misterious death of Ken Ley. Sucide also resulted as a consequence of this crash.  Many people have no savings yet has anyone gone to jail over this yet?  Watch how much fun they were having in the hay day of Enron.  How they played hard and how a few people got really rich while others were devistated.  This is an imporatant movie.  Then you might want to review the more recent news on the company to see where we are at now.  Where is Jeffrey Skilling now??  Last I knew he still was not in Jail.  Who will be punished for this or is it okay because of our new corporate climate?  Okay in the sense of the law of the USA that is.  Martha Stewart went to jail and served time will anyone for this???

I am a CPA &amp; I watched the film in an ethics class we are required to take, essentially because of the fall of Enron. I have since bought the video &amp; watched it at least 5 other times. Of course there are political slants. For example, they try &amp; tie the Bush administration(s)(Sr. &amp; Jr.) to Enron. But, the majority of the film deals with what happened to Enron, so that in the end, the stock you purchased was worth $0. I would highly recommend any person interested in business or the fraud aspect in business to watch this documentary. A riveting documentary on the rise &amp; fall of Enron &amp; who the major players in Enron were.

Kenneth Lay and his cohorts were looking to make millions not for the company but for themselves. They took advantage of the investors, the employees and the public. They knew what they were doing and were stopping at nothing to get what they wanted. The chips came crashing down when speculation from a Fortune magazine writer saw that the financial figures didn't add up. Skilling knew that the company was facing severe trouble if it were found that they were tampering with numbers and taking millions from the corporation. Enron fell hard like the World Trade Center when it was reported that its earnings were dropping like flies and bankruptcy was the ultimate demise.
The documentary explores the dark side of humans. Lay, Skilling and Fastow were ruthless as well as greedy hoarding large sums of money for their personal use putting employees out of work and leaving them with no nest egg. They cashed out their stocks and rested on their earnings while their side employees have to suffer not only the financially but emotionally.
This is a very good documentary to watch. No one should be scared not to invest in the stock market. But always be careful and alert as to how this company is operating

At first, I wasn't too keen on seeing this movie- Its title, ENRON-THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM- suggested to me that it would be about a bunch of smart guys number crunching on their way to faking accounting records.  What else would a bunch of 'smart guys' do?

Well, certainly the Enron executives did this.  The film explains in easy to understand terms how Chief Operating Officer Jeff Skilling demanded the use of 'Mark to Marketing' - an accounting scheme allowing him to post 'future profits' of an new idea immediately (ie, if an idea of inventing a new spaceship design is expected to reap a billion dollars in the future, one could post the profits now, never mind that the ship may never get built, if built may not work as envisioned, or people may loose interest in space, and so on.) Of course, such profits were not 'real' but nicely balanced off Enron's actual massive losses.  Also balancing off Enron's massive losses were the fake companies created by Andy Fastow, which he used to bury Enron's enormous debts- and in the meantime, pocketed millions for himself.

But while shady accounting schemes may explain the technical, proximate causes of the fall of Enron, it is not the ultimate explanation.  The ultimate reason why Enron fell is pure, naked, ugly- and all to human- Greed.   And this is what the film portrays, and does so brilliantly, with insider footage showing 'Enron skits' and meetings, and recordings of conversations and deals being made in the trading floor.

We get to see Jeff Skilling in a skit in which he snickers and mocks his own accounting strategy, stating "...we can add a kazillion dollars to the bottom line."  We see Andy Fastow in an insider video, with a sly grin on his face, explaining to greedy bankers (all the big guns like Citibank, Deutsche Bank, etc) his scheme to be the CFO of both his shell company LJM and Enron.  Never mind any conflict of interest, as he will always be on 'LJM's side of the transaction" (netting both him and the greedy bankers money at the expense of Enron). 

Even worse was the greedy, cut throat culture that developed among Enron traders.  My jaw dropped as I heard one trader coolly telling a California energy power station to 'power down' for a bit, by 'making up' an excuse, so they could artificially limit California's energy supply to make obscene profits.  Even worse were traders laughing hysterically and cheering as energy power lines burned in California, chanting "Burn Baby Burn!!"  And why not?  Supposedly a young trader could make enough in one afternoon to buy a Mercedes Benz, flat out!

Other facets of the ugly face of Enron included the bizarre 'extreme sport' trips taken by Enron Execs (bunch of guys riding motor cycles in the dirt) and the practice of taking clients out to strip clubs and charging it to the corporate account (exemplified by Lou Pai, but was popular among the rest as well- when this was eventually cancelled at the severe protest of some female employees, apparently a pall of silence fell over the trading floor for 3 days!).  There is also Enron's arrogance that it could 'trade' everything, including the weather!

Jeff Skilling comes off as particularly arrogant- he states he wanted to help FORTUNE reporter Bethany Mclean "understand what she is asking" when she wanted to know why Enron's numbers didn't add up. When despite his bullying, she decided to publish her findings (or lack of) anyway, he amazingly calls her decision 'unethical.'  Well, clearly, Mclean did know what she was asking- "IS ENRON OVERPRICED" was the first article suggesting something maybe wrong with Enron.  Later, he calls someone else who questioned the validity of Enron's accounting an "a-- h---."

Compared to Skilling and the others, Ken Lay comes off as rather clueless, but just as greedy. It is almost as if he didn't really care what went on in his company, as long as it made money.  We see him on 9-11-2001 comparing Enron's troubles to 9-11, but stating with confidence that things will bounce back.  Later, when Enron is in a free fall, he makes bizarre claims to his worried employees that the company is strong, and will regain healthy stock figures, causing one of his employees to ask him "are you are on crack."  Indeed.  

The film also highlights the fact that guilt for the Enron debacle falls far beyond Enron itself.  Greedy corporate banks actively participated in illegal money-making deals with Fastow, as mentioned above.  Accounting firm Arthur Anderson happily cooked Enron's books with Mark-to-Marketing accounting and other accounding frauds, and then shredded millions of documents when investigations began.  Stock analysts happily took Jeff Skilling's word that Enron's stock was doing great- and issued 'strong buy' or 'buy' ratings, without actually analyzing the stock.  Lawyers signed off on everything.  And the rest of us, dazzled by the stock market boom and greedy at the thought of making big bucks, kept buying Enron stock.  No one ever "asked why" Enron was such a shining star- and whether it really deserved to be.    

The insider material on Enron (the recordings, the videos) alone would have made a fascinating, shocking tale.  But the movie adds incisive, fast paced interviews with both insiders and critics of Enron, as well as catchy, and very appropriate theme tunes.  (`Dear Mr. Fantasy' for Andy Fastow is particularly appropriate- as it sounds like `Dear Mr. Fastow!')

As Amazon suggests, watch this move with THE CORPORATION.  THE CORPORATION provides the theoretical background as to the psychopathic nature of all corporations, while this movie provides the perfect, feature length case-study.

****1/2

Don't be surprised if you find yourself throwing things at the screen while watching "Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room," a brilliantly effective and meticulously researched documentary (based on the book by Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind) that is guaranteed to get both your dander and your adrenaline up to dangerously high levels.

Rarely does a real life event provide us with as clear and universally recognized a symbol of a larger social theme as does the fall of Enron, which, in the years since it happened, has come to stand for everything that's wrong with corporate America.  It is the classic tale of corruption and unethical behavior performed in the service of unbridled greed.  That the men responsible for the disaster took so many innocent people down with them is what makes it a tragedy.  In fact, more than one person interviewed for the film draws the parallel between the downfall of Enron and the sinking of the Titanic - an apt analogy if ever there was one, only, in this case, the captains had no intention of going down with the ship, preferring instead to ruthlessly knock over any number of helpless women and children in the desperate race to the lifeboats. 

The beauty of the film is that it takes a very complex and convoluted story and makes it completely comprehensible to those of us who might otherwise get lost in the maze of arcane corporate-world details.   The movie introduces us to the key players - primarily CEOs Jeffrey Skilling and Ken Lay, and CFO Andrew Fastow - showing the step-by-step process by which they built the energy corporation virtually from scratch, raised it to the position of seventh largest company in the world, then slowly destroyed it through deceit, hubris and greed - but not, of course, before bestowing obscene multi-million dollar packages on themselves as compensation.  We see how they employed little more than smoke-and-mirror accounting schemes to pull the wool over the eyes of investors, regulatory commissions and fellow employees.  However, the film makes it clear that a large number of "reputable" banks and loan agencies must also have been complicit in the company's malfeasance for all of this to have come off so effectively.   

As always, it is the "little guy" who winds up getting shafted.  Probably the greatest hair-pulling section of the film involves Enron's cold-blooded creation and manipulation of California's bogus "energy crisis" in the early 2000's, which drained billions from the state`s treasury, a situation which the newly elected President Bush, ever sympathetic to his buddies in the energy business, refused to help rectify.  Just as bad is the CEOs' callous encouragement of their own lower level employees to invest their retirement savings in the company's 401K plan that the chief executives themselves knew would soon be defunct.  With hissable villains like these around, who needs fiction?

The sole consolation is the fact that the system did work in the end, that the wrongdoers eventually overreached to such an extent that the house of cards they had built finally came tumbling down.  There's certainly a great deal of joy in seeing the creeps responsible for the catastrophe being carted off to jail in handcuffs and sweating under the public scrutiny of a congressional investigative committee.  (It should be noted that the film predates Ken Lay's death in 2006).  The movie also balances the case by highlighting some of the "heroes" in the story, primarily whistleblowers within the company and a resourceful reporter for FORTUNE magazine who was the first to hint in a public forum that Enron might just be the corporate equivalent of the emperor with no clothes.

This is more than just a mere "talking heads" documentary.  It explores the details of the story within the broader context of unbridled capitalism, de-regulation, and corporate corruption.  The movie also shows us how strangely immature the men at the head of this company were, with their frat boy antics and the daredevil activities they indulged in to erase their "nerd" image and to establish their bona fides as real "macho" men.  The fact that individuals of this caliber could spell the ruin of so many trusting people is what gives the movie's title that little ironic kick.

By all means, don't miss this film - though you might want to have a good stiff drink handy for when it's over

Plot twists everywhere!  A movie of many mini-dramas in one, but blended together so well it's an exhilirating rollercoaster of love, lust, and the bonds of family.

We don't know anything about Maggie (Karyn Dwyer) before she comes to this "interesting part of town" other than she's left university to find herself, and BE herself.  She gets a phone call from her mother, who doesn't know she's a lesbian, and the fun begins.  Mother Lila, (Wendy Crewson) is divorcing her husband and with brother Paul (Kevin Mundy) in tow, needs a place to stay.  Maggie finds a loft as a sublet, but there is a snag.  After performing a lip synching at a club she's met the girl of her dreams.  Kim (Christina Cox) is staying with Maggie as well, now to keep the affair from Lila!  Kim is torn.  She wants Maggie to come out to her mother so they don't have to hide their relationship.  She wants Maggie to be able to openly declare her love for her, but Maggie is so afraid.  The fear ultimatly threatens to tear the two women apart.

We meet Maggie's friends, her boss Frances (Ann-Marie MacDonald), her friend, a transexual named Judy (Jerry Outerbridge), her co-worker Carla (Marya Delver), and coffee shop owner Tony (Tony Nappo).  Frances is at war with Customs, as they continually threaten her livlihood by witholding shipments of books and videos for her store.  Carla is a bi-sexual free spirit who "likes hard centers, soft centers, all the chocolates in the box".  Judy, who is under the misundersanding that her father has forgiven her for becoming a transexual befriends Lila and starts bringing her around to Maggie's point of view.  

Inadvertantly, Maggie's friends begin introducing Lila and Paul to new and exciting experiences.  Maggie's fears of coming out to her mother are soon alieviated when Lila discovers her in bed with Kim and the conflict grows.  Amid gay bashing and hate crimes the outcome of the movie is perfectly tied up and delightful.  Helped along with an astounding soundtrack this is one movie you simply MUST add to your collection

I really hope that no one was expecting an Oscar worthy performance. No it`s not the best movie ever as far as plot and acting but, I don`t remember seeing too many high dollar ads for it, do you? It was a DAMN good feel good movie though. 
This movie will help point out a few issues the GLBT community faces but barely scratches the surface. If it is erotic lesbians you seek, KEEP SEEKING. Even the uncut version is barely "R" worthy.

So once again everyone, NOT a pent house flick, NOT a documentary AND in no way is it Oscar worthy, and with all that said, It was one of the best ROMANTIC COMEDIES I`ve seen in a long time. I highly recomend it to anyone just looking for a relaxing evening

It's hard to mix a meaningful, important message with fun and laughs. Better Than Chocolate is the best example of that successful combination. An important plot full of emotion and difficult situations mixes with humor and sexuality to create a full plate of entertainment with this film. Character development is superb, making the viewing experience that much more interesting. There's not a boring part. In fact, more than one story harmoniously combines with others to engage the mind and senses. The film is not a serious drama. But it's not only a comedy. The characters are real. The humor flows naturally. Even though I know how the story ends, I'll watch it over and over

My partner and I really enjoyed this movie there are alot of issues that we can relate to. Judy gives trans gender people a good name. All the caracters rolls are positive and I think that it shows its not all about sex, there is love involved. Definetly a must see!!!

when i first watched this movie yes i did realize it was poorly written and what ever but i love this movie because it helped me to get courage to finally tell my mom i was gay. i think this person who left the last comment was way too dramatic,they just dont know how to appreciate things, also he threw it way out of proportion by saying he should've got RENT. what a stupid idea, rent was even worse

This really didn't help me understand the mind of lesbians.  It was poorly written or acted or presented or something.  I was looking for insight to try and gain appreciation for the lifestyle so that I could better understand the culture, but was left with a silly sex movie.  Very disappointed.   I regret the purchase... should have gotten RENT instead

Thank God for this essentially preserved movie version of the stage hit by one of my all time favorite broadway actresses Gwen Verdon. She just lights up the screen. Bob Fosse's dances are spectacular and the music by Ross and Adler is just classic. They just don't make them like this anymore. Sheer heaven in hell-with the devil played by the incomparable Ray Walston. If you love musicals, you must add this to your collection!

Certain movies really capture the feel of their themes, and this one is the one movie that really captures the magic of Baseball like no other. Of course there is a great moral lesson to be learned. But haven't we learned by now, that the Devil has no good purpose in wanting to help us to achieve our goals? I hope so. What a great cast of performers. Nothing was lost from the Broadway stage in this production. And nothing is lost from the movie in this excellent transfer to DVD. Through the magic of Hollywood, when done to perfection, film can even enhance the story. And few have done the job with a Musical as well as this Gem. Thanks largely to the astounding talent of Bob Fosse's choreography. Tab Hunter's shining moment. Gwen Verdon's 'Whatever Lola Wants' is the showstopper, but Ray Walston steals the entire film as an extremely funny Devil. A film favorite for most of my life

Once upon a time, Broadway musicals were quickly adapted into successful widescreen presentations, often, but not always, with the original Broadway stars.  This is an example of one of Hollywood's best.
A previous reviewer called this stagebound.  I am not sure what was meant.  "My Fair Lady" and "Mary Poppins" are musicals shot entirely on soundstages, and look it; "Damn Yankees!" involved several outside locations, including the old Los Angeles Wrigley Field, which was home to the Los Angeles Angels in their first season in 1961.  It was a great backdrop for the "Shoeless Joe" number.
The film is not in stereo (even though the CD soundtrack is); I don't know if the stereo soundtrack album would matchup with the film soundtrack, or whether there stereo tracks recorded.  In any event, Warner Bros. did not dig them out, and this DVD is bereft of any significant extras.
Apart from that, this is a must buy for classic performances (Ray Walston and Gwen Verdon, particularly), wonderful songs ((You Gotta Have) Heart, Shoeless Joe, etc.), and some great smaller roles (the crusty Senators' manager, Jean Stapleton playing Edith Bunker 15 years before she played Edith Bunker, and Bob Fosse dancing with Gwen Verdon)

The audio/video quality of the original movie is not quite up to modern picture and sound standards, and the original play and movie we indelibly tied to the 50's scene ("Cool, man"), but the transition to DVD has not hurt it a bit. The songs and dancing are very stylized, definitely reflecting Donen's handicraft. Seeing the actors when they were almost kids is very interesting. I definitely enjoyed it

Ray Walston is perfect as the endearingly likable devil, Gwen Virdon is teriffic as Lola the vamp and Tab Hunter is perfectly believable as Joe Hardy.  Great dancing, great songs "Gotta have heart," "Whatever Lola Wants" and "Two Lost Souls" great love story and great actual shots of Mickey Mantle and Gil MacDougald in action makes for a winner

With an all-star cast, direction with the artistry characteristic of a Spike Lee joint, and a plot with so many twists and turns it was hard to guess the ending,  Inside Man is an above-average heist thriller.  However, as many reviewers have pointed out it is from a director who makes a habit of underlying his story with social commentary, and Inside Man is no exception.  At times it seemed as if the movie was supposed to serve as an expose on the importance of wealth in contemporary America.  From a child's violent video game whose point is to get rich or die trying, to a wealthy mogul who made his fortune from one of the worst tragedies in history, Lee makes a point of showing that all that glitters is not gold.  I liked that part of the movie, but I can understand how others are bored with Lee's tactics.  Overall, the plot, direction, and all-star cast are the most stellar parts of this film and they are reason enough to give it a chance

Spike Lee finally came through on his fourth film with Mr. Washington.  This film is very moving and intriguing. Nail biting.  Exciting.  Smart casting and directing.  Clive Owen wanted to help out those who deserve it, unlike the big tycoon entrepreneur...selling himself out and trying to hide his past.  This film demonstrated that everyone has demons, and no matter how hard someone tries to hide the past, and how rich you are...there will be someone out there who is smarter and willing to take even bigger risks to reward himself and at the same time reveal the true meaning of pride.  Furthermore, Jodie was playing a dirty lawyer.  Stopping at nothing to achieving her greed on the front page and scoring points to achieve the unremarkable...betrayal.

This film had all aspects of our human nature.  What more can anyone ask for.  It makes you think...Would you risk your life to prove that someone else's life is worth more than yours if you get caught?

"Inside Man" unfolds its characters and plot in seeming slow-motion -- perhaps a bit like a real-life hostage drama. The film's plot advances by millimeters, in a seemingly unknowable direction. Folding back upon itself via the use of flash forwards and dramatized hypotheticals, the film always returns to the present, sometimes, but not always enriched by its wanderings.

A well-planned hostage situation develops at a New York City bank. Dozens of hostages are taken, and they are cowed into submission by acts of profanity and violence. Keith Frazier, an NYPD detective and hostage negotiator played by Denzel Washington, is brought in to get into the minds of the criminals and to end the crisis. But this is no ordinary hostage situation, as the hostage-takers aren't playing by the normal rules. What are they after? Why are they stalling for time? 

The bank's philanthropist owner (Christopher Plummer) has taken an unusual interest in the situation. When he contacts a high society fixer (Jodi Foster) to retrieve property from the besieged bank, it becomes clear that he has a greater stake in the crisis than the good name of his bank. Foster, Washington and the lead hostage taker (played with intelligence and canny reserve by Clive Owen) soon find themselves in a dance of wills and activity.

Spike Lee's cinematography is terrific. A long shot of the Brooklyn Bridge  is just one of many ornaments to this well-made film. The writing and the plot are believable -- and hold back on the unrelenting sarcastic chatter that makes up so many forgettable cop movies. The final plot lines are not tied up until literally the final few seconds of the film.

Other than the pace of the film -- which mimics the wait-and-see pace of real negotiations (but is slow to the point of torpor) -- "Inside Man" is brilliant

I've seen quite a few movies trying to win the title "The prefect bank robbery" for the crime they describe. This one wins the jackpot. 

The robbery's whole concept is ingenious. Just when I thought there couldn't be any real innovations in this field comes "Inside Man" to show me how wrong I was. From the beginning to the end, this film is nothing but professional and completely believable - I watched the screen and said to myself: "for heaven's sake, people could actually pull it off!". Add to that the top notch cast - Denzel Washington, Judie Foster and Clive Owen - and you get a film you wouldn't want to miss.

I have seen the original Dutch version by Director Sluizer, and this one holds up quite well on its own. Jeff Harriman (Kiefer Sutherland) stops at a gas station with his girlfriend Diane (Sandra Bullock). In a matter of minutes, she disappears without a trace. And although Jeff searches everywhere for her, she vanishes without ever being heard from again. He lives every moment of his life trying to locate her. Putting flyers everywhere, and even going on TV.

The abducter of Diane is Barney Cousins (Jeff Bridges). I don't wish to give away the plot about what happened to her, however, I will write that Barney contacts Jeff and tells him that he admires his persistence in trying to locate Diane after so many years. He gives Jeff a chance to experience what happened to Diane, but at a cost. Enter Rita Baker (Nancy Travis) who is also the latest love interest of Jeff. Her role in the film is very important. Barney Cousins is a sociopath, and he has been abducting women for some time. How long, the viewer is never told, but it is not a spur of the moment type of abduction. He is very methodical.

As I wrote in the beginnig, I have seen the original, and while it is quite good, this film also is a very good and suspenseful film. The character of the sociopath, played by Jeff Bridges is very good. He is very convincing in his part. As for Kiefer Sutherland, I thought he gave a very good performance. Disregard some of the negative reviews on this film. Just because the original is on Criterion, and in Dutch, does not necessarily negate this very good and suspensful film. I have the DVD, but it is only listed on VHS at amazon. It might be out of print. If you can, grab the DVD; I assure you that you will not be disappointed. [Stars: 4.5]

An extraordinary film, The Vanishing, brings to the screen the story of a young man as he searches for his missing girlfriend in the American Northwest.
The movie falls into the action/adventure/mystery/thriller type of category.
Kiefer Sutherland, Jeff Bridges, Nancy Travis, Sandra Bullock, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!  
The setting, the plot (Jeff's strong sense of love, devotion, and determination are admirable and commendable, and an example for all to follow!), the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!
In short, The Vanishing is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!

This movie starts a little slow, but builds quickly into a suspenseful thriller.  Bridges does an excellent job playing a psycho and masterfully pulls off that little "thing" that just makes him creepy.  Typical of an early 90s thriller, this movie is sure to entertain.  If you liked "Fear" then you will like "The Vanishing" as well

George Sluizer's original Dutch-French version of The Vanishing (aka The Man Who Wanted to Know) offers one of European cinema's most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths, feeling his way one step at a time towards murder. If you've seen that version, you probably still can't get the final revelation out of your head, but the film had plenty more to offer than that, playing with chronology, subverting the usual cliches of its 'Lady Vanishes' plot (the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive) and throwing in some excellent characterization. I can only assume that for this 1993 US remake Sluizer was so determined that no-one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself, but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work. His career never recovered.

Chief culprit is an astonishing performance by Jeff Bridges that has been overthought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level. A friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that Bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing, and this film is the proof of the pudding. Every movement is overly mechanical in its precision, making him look like a rusty clockwork toy, while his voice is a bizarre mixture of Tootsie, Latka Gravas from Taxi and a Dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from Dok-tah E-ville. No banality of evil here, just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying "Please. Let. Me. Kill. You. Thank you. For your. Consideration.' 

But the blame really needs to be shared out here. None of the performances are good: often, they don't even look good - Keifer Sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station, Nancy Travis flounders badly and Sandra Bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession. Not that they're given any help by either director or writer Todd Graff. The script is particularly weak. The chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on Bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film. Worse is the rush the film is in, draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next. Rather than the high/low mood shifts in the couple's relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location, we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he's probably better off without her. As for the new and improved happy ending - standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame `let's end on a joke like a TV cop show' moment - best not go there... which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie. Even a shockingly bland and uninspired Jerry Goldsmith score can't do anything for this one.

    In 1988, director George Sluizer had directed a film entitled, THE VANISHING. The film was all in Dutch and starred Dutch actors, who are nowhere near well-known in this country.

    In 1993, director George Sluizer, who had directed the original Dutch film, had decided to direct a remake of his own film, this time, casting a well-known cast that consists of Kiefer Sutherland, Nancy Travis, Sandra Bullock, &amp; Jeff Bridges. The film is almost the same as the original Dutch version, but this one is much more worth the time and money.

    JEFF HARRIMAN (played by Kiefer Sutherland) and his girlfriend, DIANE SHAVER (played by Sandra Bullock) are driving to the mountains for vacation. They have a little spout, after their car runs out of gas, while in a dark tunnel. Leaving Diane there, Jeff heads off to get enough gas to drive them to a nearby gas station. He comes back to find Diane sitting outside the other end of the tunnel, upset and distraught. They pull into a gas station, where Diane has Jeff, who laughs with cheerfulness, repeat an apology. They kiss passionately, where Diane heads into the store to buy her and Jeff some cold beers. A half-hour goes by and Diane has not yet returned. He searches the store, as well as the whole ground, but Diane is nowhere to be found.

    Three years later, Jeff is still on the hunt for his beloved girlfriend. Every month for the last three years, Jeff would renew the posters he had printed of Diane. He has even gone to the local newspapers and national television news stations and pleaded with the person who had kidnapped Diane to tell him where she is. He walks into a diner one night, still very miserable, and meets RITA BAKER (played by Nancy Travis). Rita is instantly attracted to Jeff. Jeff and Rita begin a love affair together. Jeff tries to move on with his life, but he cannot, for he is still searching for Diane. Rita finds out about what Jeff is doing behind her back. She tries to help get over his obsession, but it doesn't work. Jeff receives a letter from a man named BARNEY COUSINS (played by Jeff Bridges). Jeff shows Rita the letter, but she realizes that his obsession is still going on, where she leaves him. She goes to their appartment, packs her things, changes the outgoing message on their answering machine. Jeff returns home and changes the machine himself, but as the recording is still going, Barney appears. Jeff beats the hell out of him, but Barney reveals that he can tell him where Diane is, and that in order for Jeff to find out what happened to her, he'd have to ride with Barney.

    While at a bar with her girlfriend, Rita calls her appartment to let her girlfriend her the outgoing message, but Rita hears that Jeff had already changed it, to which she finds Barney's voice on the machine. She realizes that Jeff is in danger and rushes over to help him, but Jeff and Barney are already on their way.

    Rita finds out what happened from her neighbor, where her neighbor gives Rita the license plate number to Barney's car. With this License Plate #, Rita finds out where Barney lives and drives off to his place.

    Jeff and Barney arrive at the gas station where Diane was last seen three years earlier. Barney hands Jeff a cup of coffee, where Barney informs Jeff that the coffee is drugged. He tells Jeff that in order to find out what happened to Diane, Jeff has to go through the exact same details that Diane had gone through. Jeff, through hurtful tears, drinks the coffee and blacks out. He wakes up to darkness. He flips on his lighter to find himself locked...in a coffin and...buried alive outside Barney's vacation cabin in the woods. Barney had done this to poor Diane, who, after three years of being buried in the ground without anyone coming to her aid, is now dead.

    Rita arrives at Barney's house, where she meets Barney's daughter, DENISE (played by Maggie Linderman). She asks Rita to giver her a ride to the carnival, as long as she doesn't say a word to to Barney. Rita asks Denise how to get to the summer cabin where Barney is at. Denise gives her the directions and Rita is on her way. She arrives and has a brief brawl with Barney. She stops when he is about to kill her. She is now seated inside his cabin, talking with Barney, trying to find out what he did with Jeff. She notices the dirt on his shoes, the dirt on a shovel, standing beside the door, and realizes that she had seen a long spot on the ground without grass, and realizes that Barney had buried Jeff alive. She knocks Barney and begins digging up Jeff. But not before Barney awakens and begins brawling again with Rita. Did Jeff suffocate and bite the dust as Diane had done? Will Barney kill of Rita as well? The only way to find is to watch this 1993 remake of THE VANISHING.

    I have read the reviews from many Amazon.com reviewers and I cannot believe that anyone would hate this remake. So what? The ending was changed. I do not find that a good enough reason to hate this movie. This movie was just outstanding and was much better than the remake. Kiefer Sutherland, again, proves that he is the best actor on this planet, maybe even in this whole galaxy. This movie is one Kiefer's best starring roles and I recommend it to any Kiefer Sutherland fan who has not yet seen this film

Why did they even bother transferring this movie to DVD?  Seriously?  The [...] child of a masterpiece, "The Vanishing" sports some of the most half-hearted performances and sometimes downright hilarious performances of the 90's.

This isn't a matter of comparison.  This movie, all by itself, just sucks. If I hadn't seen the original I'd just think, "what a brilliant plot, too bad they decided to bury it (no pun intended) with everything else in the movie". Jeff Bridges manages an unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic professor; his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great, gut wrenchingly disturbing, Hitchcockian 1988 movie.  Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are themselves, which add nothing to the movie. 

And the ending.  Oh, the ending.  We've been cheated.  Totally cheated.  All the power that this clunker might have had is torn away in a fervor of "It has to be upbeat!" Hollywood cornball syndrome.  Sandra Bullock is RESCUED, the villain is hit with a shovel, and everything is A-OK!  Even though Kiefer Sutherland's original girlfriend has been buried alive and suffocated.  This is [...]of a great movie.

I glad there is someone besides me that is fed up with the insufferable bores who automatically think a film is "intellectual" because it is made anywhere but the USA.

Boyz n the Hood was one of the most important movies of the 1990's. It is both an excellent movie about life in the mean streets of the inner city as well as a reinforcer of the moral values needed to turn around the situation in Urban America where youth gangs run rampant. During the course of the story, it offers much needed commentary on the
situation that young people find themselves in and how they can get out of it.

At the start of the movie there is a subtitle that says "One out of every 21 black males will be murdered in his lifetime, most will be killed at the hands of another black male." If anything, that fact is even worse today. Most flicks today that are about the inner city crime scene have taken many of their concepts from this film, but many of these
films today are all shoot `em up movies that have no morality, strong plot or serious social message.

The setting of this flick is South Central L.A.: Where murder rates are five times the nationwide average, or in absolute figures, double the entire U.S.'s death rate for breast cancer. Over the past two decades the Los Angeles Police Department has accumulated a backlog of 4,400 unsolved homicides - roughly 3/4ths of the city's total.

This gripping tale evolves around a single black father, Furious Styles (Laurence Fishburne), raising his one and only son, Tr� Styles (Cuba Gooding Jr.), and installing in him the values to help him become a man. This is an important point that director John Singleton took time to illustrate since the majority of men in the black community are often raised by their single mothers. The values that Furious Styles instills in Tre are generally not portrayed in most movies today.

Essentially, Boyz n the Hood is a movie about peace. Its message is that violence isn't the answer, and this movie shows the effects of violence being what residents of the inner city all too frequently resorts to when there are other alternatives available. 

The movie starts when Tre's mother sends him
to live with his father Jason, a/k/a "Furious", who
is much better equipped to raise a son in a neighborhood like this. The movie quickly moves forward seven years when seventeen year old Tre and his best friend Ricky about to graduate from high school, while
another friend Doughboy has already graduated - from
shoplifting to guns and small-time drug deals. And while Furious guides Tre towards moral choices, responsibility and self-respect, Doughboy and Ricky are raised by a mother who lacks the capacity to instill proper values and morals in her offspring. 

The basic plot to Boyz n the Hood is can Tre avoid the crime and drug scene and live a normal, decent life? This is all the more challenging given all the crime and violence around him. Boyz n the Hoodis an excellent film that is a drama based on real human beings. It shows the
dire straits that folks in the South Central are in without being conscending or exploitative. Boyz n the Hood is a flick that is well written, acted and directed. The cinematography is stunning

This is truly a BRILLIANT movie in that it lets one have an unvarnished look into how the "real" hood is really like.  For me this was nothing less than educational.  I could see how individuals may be caught in a web of circumstances and locale (the hood) which they are powerless to escape or ignore.  This is more than just a movie, it is a powerful statement by a visionary director that tears the stereotyes down, and exposes the humanity of the characters.  When watching the movie, I could clearly relate to the characters and feel their pain and anguish --- these were not just thugs and criminals from a poor neighborhood, but humans with hopes, feelings and aspirations, just like you and me.  What more can I say, except: BRAVO!

This is not only a thrilling story on the life of a group of African Americans but it also captures the reality of the streets of L.A. As you watch the movie you see the life surrounding this group of black friends. You truly become attached to the characters and begin to feel that they cant do anything to escape the struggle they have been in since they were born. Ice Cube the main character plays a gangbanger who is living the life of a criminal, from fights on the corner, to drive by shootings.
This movie truly captures the struggle millions of African Americans go through. As we watch the kids grow up in the ghetto, to when they are old enough to get out, they still seem to be the same. Their customs dont change, simply because of their surrounding, guns, liquor, poverty, and crime. They have no other option than do join in. 
When dough boy's(Ice Cube) brother Ricky is offered a scholarship to play college football it looks like a way to get out of the ghetto. The whole family feels as this a way for them to escape it also, so everyone is supporting him. Until a tragedy is brought upon the family. This story truly proves nothings good until finally out of the hood for these boys.

Good movie from the 1990s years,Tre has to live with his dad after getting into a fight with Bobby the boy he walked to school with, I like the part when Tre,ricky,doughboy and little Chris(or Chris)were young.The part when Doughboy said she loved that fool more than she loved me. I think it was pretty obvious.I think he said fool but if he did that ment ricky.But you know what ever!I know part of this review sounds stupid

Despite what some people might think, Boyz N The Hood is in no way a film that glorifies a gangsta lifestyle.  It is a hard hitting look at growing up in the hood as a young black male in America.  I would challenge anyone to watch this film and not be emotionally moved by the events particularly at the end of the movie.  

This was John Singleton's first film as a director and it is hard to believe that a then 22 year old could write such a powerful script.  Every actor plays their part and you can empathise with all of them, Cuba gooding Jr is superb as Tre Styles, a troubled boy who is sent to live with his strict father Furious (Lawrence Fishburne).  Furious is also played excellently by Fishburne, despite appearing as strict, he keeps Tre on the right path and as a 17 year old Tre is a mature and well rounded individual.  Tre's friends are brothers Doughboy (Ice Cube) &amp; Ricky (Morris Chestnut), two very different people, Ricky like Tre is an aspiring college student, while Doughboy is fresh out of jail, and looked down upon by his mother.  The script is so well written that even a character like Doughboy can be sympathised with, though he appears agressive and trigger happy on the surface, he is also loyal and caring to his friends.  It is the depth of all the characters, and several superb acting performances that make the film so great.

I don't want to give away any plot details for those who haven't seen it, but the film is really tragic in the end, and is a realistic take on life in the hood in South Central.  I don't care where your from or what colour your skin is, you can enjoy and be moved by this film, a true masterpiece

Boyz N the Hood is an oustanding movie about a young man named Tre Styles who grows up on the hostile and violent streets of South Central Los Angeles. After a confrontation with a classmate at his school, Tre's mother forces him to go and live with his father Furious. She says, " The last thing I want is to see you end up a drunk hanging out in front of one of these liquor stores or killed. Look at me, I'm serious. I love you. You're my only son." She just can't take his problems anymore.

After being dropped off at his fathers place, Tre grows through  5 more years of seeing what hood life is really like making him about 13 years old. All the while Furious tells Tre, "You know Tre you may think I'm being hard on you right now, but I'm not. What I'm doing is trying to teach you how to be responsible. Its like your little friends across the street, they don't have anybody to show them how to do that. And you're gonna see how they end up too." 

His next door neighbors Chris, Doughboy, and Ricky are very close and all grow up together learning how to survive the streets. Ricky is a high school all star football player and scholar who hopes to get into USC on a scholarship. Meanwhile his brother doughboy on the otherhand becomes a thug involved with a gang (the crips), pushing drugs, boozing 40s (OE), and running his mouth. 

Ricky and Tre both want to make something of their future while doughboy is just trying to survive. One night at the strip on Crenshaw, a group of bloods are strolling through, and one of them bumps into Ricky on purpose trying to start crap. He says, "F*** you lookin at nigga?" Ricky shouts back, "I'm still trying to find out nigga!" Doughboy hears the confrontation taking place, rushes up with his homeboys right by his side and says "We got a problem here? We got a problem? He pulls aside his coat flashing a .45 concealed in his pants and flashes gang signs.

The bloods flash gang signs back. Doughboy pulls back the slide on his gat (cocking it). The gangsters give him a dirty look, turn their backs and walk away. Right when the crowds are ready to leave, the bloods open the trunk of their tricked out hyundai and fire a fully automatic uzi in the air. Ricky and Tre drive off together saying, "can't go nowhere without getting all shot up and crap." They get pulled over and hassled by the cops. Tre drives over to his girlfriends house and he shows sad and angry emotions. She comforts him and they end up making love.
 
About 15-20 minutes near the end of the movie, Rickys wife asks him to go the the convenience store to get some cornmeal. He walks a few blocks from his house with tre and walks out of the store with the cornmeal, a container of milk, and several lottery tickets. Ricky and Tre are walking back home and Ricky is totally unaware that his SAT scores for college are waiting for him when he gets home. He scored just enough to get him accepted into USC. The red hyundai pulls up on a side street and the bloods inside are saying, "Theres that bastard that was talking smack the other night." The gangsters grab their guns and the car peels out around the corner catching Ricky and Tre running and ducking into an alley near a wooden fence down the street. The fellas inside the car are shouting, "Cut him off man. Lets kill him. Come on man, go." The leader of the gang steps on the gas and the car races down the street after them. Doughboy and his homies are waiting on the porch chilling when the red car races past with its system booming.

Doughboy knows something is up and he races inside, grabs his gat, and the guys jump into the car, racing to find Ricky &amp; Tre. Ricky and Tre are walking down the alley. Ricky is finishing scratching off his lottery ticket when the car full of bloods pulls up. Tre shouts, "RICKY!" Ricky sees the car, drops his bag, and runs as fast as he can away from the car. By that time it is too late. A 12 gauge shotgun gets raised and blasts two shots. The first one hits him in the legs to cripple him and the 2nd shot hits him blowing a hole in his chest, knocking him to the ground.
 
There is so much blood all over. Tre tries to comfort him Ricky and keep him concious as Doughboys car pulls up. Ricky dies in Tres arms and they take him home. Rickys mother comes unglued and the mom thinks that Doughboy is the one who shot him. She starts beating on him like crazy. Tre pulls him away from her on the porch. Tres clothes are covered from head to toe in blood and he tells Doughboy "meet me at my house in 5 minutes." Tres girlfriend tries to stop him to see whats up and he tells her to go home. Tre walks into his fathers bedroom and loads a .357 magnum. He wants to kill the guys responsible for murdering his best friend right in front of him.

Furious does his best to stop Tre from commiting murder by confronting him in the living room and demands him to hand the gun over. Tre falls into his dads arms and begins sobbing. His dad says, "Your my only son and I'm not gonna lose you to any crap. I love you man. Go clean yourself up. Go on." Tre goes back to his bedroom knowing that his buddies are outside waiting for him in the car. He jumps out the window and runs to the car jumping in the back of the car. They race off and his father and buddy Chris are thinking, "oh shoot." Tres father is very nervous because he knows what the guys plan to do after the tragic &amp; bloody afternoon. Tre does a lot of thinking in the backseat and orders his friends to pull over the car and let him out. They do as he wants. The guys in the car let him out and they drive off into the night looking for the thugs who murdered his friend. They pull into a burger joint and find the gangsters outside eating burgers at a table. They load &amp; cock a fully automatic AK-47, turn off the lights on the car, and pull a drive by shooting on every single person at the table. The car comes to a screeching halt, doughboy cocks his sidearm and runs up to the surviving gangsters and murders every single one of them in cold blood. 

They peel out of the parking lot and the following morning Tre ends up talking to Tre about how hard it is to break the cycle of violence growing up in the hood. Doughboy says, "They sure pushed the clock on Rick man. I ain't got no brother. Next thing you know somebody might try to smoke me. Don't matter though. We all gotta go sometime huh?" Tre tries to comfort him by saying, "Hey dough. You still got one brother left man." Doughboy says, "Thanks man." Doughboy and Tre embrace with a hug. Doughboy walks away pouring out his bottle of OE as an homage to his mudered brother and then a message comes up on the screen saying "2 weeks later doughboy is murdered." How sad. Personally I didn't like the ending. It wants to get out the message that the violence never seems to stop. Tre &amp; his girl survive and go to college out of state later in the fall. A very powerful and moving story that should be shown to every young man &amp; woman near high school age. Although the movie has a lot of language and is very violent, it has an important message that needs to get across to everyone.

What I enjoy most about this movie, is not what I particularly enjoyed when it first came out. Being 11 when it came out, I was attracted to the urbanism of which I was not too familiar with. I didn't exactly grow up in the best neighborhood, but it was no Inglewood either. I think many of the younger viewers were attracted to this aspect of the film; the urban youth seeing for the first time, thier lives on a film of this caliber, and the SUBurban youth somehow glorifying this life. While I still enjoy the entire film, what I particularly enjoy now is the begining of the film. The story of a troubled young boy who while having a strong mother with her head on her shoulders, can't be tamed by her. She sends him to live with his father, who is in many ways her equal. But he is a man. And one of her lines in the movie is "I can't teach him how to be a man, that's your job." How true this is. Not to sound sexist, because their are millions of young boys all over the planet who are better off with just thier mother, (because of an abusive father, etc.) but you need a man to teach you to be a man. Larry Fishburne's charachter in this movie does this perfectly. One quote, "I know you think I'm being hard on you Tre, but I'm not. What I'm trying to do is to teach you responsibility. Your friends across the street don't have anyone to do that, your'e gonna see how they end up, too." I loved how this was a story about two strong and intelligent parents (while divorced) raise their son the way they know best, and not about a junkie mom and a deadbeat dad who raise a criminal. I'd have to say that my favorite character is Furious. Yes, Reva (Tre's mom) played an equally strong part, but I loved how "real" Furious was. "Young" Tre I thought played an excellent part - better than Gooding Jr.? Maybe. Overall a great movie; it's success made it harder for corporate America to ignore the reality of inner-city youth as it exists today.

"The Sentinel" isn't a movie I entirely expected to like, although I've wanted to see it since it was in theatres. Even though the plot is different, it kept bringing to mind another movie released this year called "Firewall." Even while watching this movie, I thought it was similar to "Firewall" in many ways...But I also found myself entertained by it. Now presidential assassination movies are almost a cliche by now; but a few good ones do come around. My favorite movie of this kind is "In the Line of Fire." It was entertaining, well acted, made sense, and was a great film. The Sentinel has good performances, it's entertaining, but it doesn't always make sense. It's never really explained why the people in this film want to kill the president. Even if they just want to do it to do it, they could've told us that. Inside Man told us the bankrobbers just wanted to do it in the beginning. Anyway, Oscar winner Michael Douglas (Best Actor, 'Wall Street') plays Pete Garrison, a Secret Service agent who once took a bullet for Ronald Reagan. Years later, Pete is having an affair with the first lady (Kim Basinger) and is at odds with his former best friend David Breckinridge (a marvelous Kiefer Sutherland), also a Secret service agent. See David is under the impression that Pete had an affair with his wife. Anyway, through a rat, Pete discovers that there's a mole in the Secret Service who's helping terrorists plot to kill the President. At the same time, Pete is getting anonymously blackmailed for his affair with the first lady and, as a result of that, evidence is piling up on the fact that Pete maybe the mole. Now with the entire Secret Service after him, including David and his new partner Jill (Eva Longoria, who's got some good acting chops away from Wisteria Lane). This movie has its share of cliches. There was a few times where I was watching this movie and thinking to myself "that sounds/looks familiar." I saw the end coming from a mile away. But, the ending quickly redeems itself (from my point-of-view anyway) with the relationship between Pete and the first lady not going in the direction you'd think. A lot of people won't like this film for reasons I've mentioned and more...But if you want some semi-mindless entertainment (although this movie has its smart characteristics blending in with its flaws), then The Sentinel is actually a pretty good way to pass the time. Due to its flaws, with only the fact that I enjoyed it to support my case, I should give it 4 stars...But I think that it's worthy enough of 5.
Entertainment goes a long way.

GRADE: A

I actually liked this movie and I don't understand the bad reviews maybe they were expecting a smarter movie I don't know. Anyways the plot was easy to follow and made some sense and the action was okay. I am not going into the movies detail because I don't want to ruin the story for somebody. I will recommend this movie to people and most will enjoy it but those crazy people that like perfect movies and complain about every detail will not enjoy it all. Rent it then maybe buy it if you like it

I cannot believe how many negative reviews this film actually received.  Were they watching the same movie I was watching?  I generally concider myself very critical when it comes to political thrillers such as "The Sentinel", so I am not going to just generally give such a movie of one of my favorite genres a high rating automatically without giving it some fore-thought.  "The Sentinel" is everything that an intense, well-crafted political thriller should be.  The acting is quite convincing and the suspense is riveting.  I guarantee you will be pinned to the edge of your seat through the entire film and then some.  Also, the scenario is extremely plausible, especially in today's world, with all the militant groups out there--from neo-Nazis to Islamic radicals--who would stop at nothing to make an assination attempt or terrorist attack against the President or some U.S. institution.  My advice is, before listening to the negative rants of the other reviewers of this film, go ahead and take a look at it yourself.  It's a safe bet that you will not be disappointed.

I own the first two volumes of the Lost Treasures series and am waiting for the third to arrive on my doormat. They are brilliant and I hope more volumes appear on a regular basis.
Why though, must I suffer for purchasing these titles when they are released by not being able to get The Plays volume without buying them all over again?
I suspect (and hope) that it will eventually be released seperately but in the meantime I can only say that if you don't already own any of these and are a fan of Broadway, theatre or the performing arts in general, buy this today! A fantastic showcase of theatrical talent

Being a farm boy from Illinois, "the-ay-ter" could have been in a foreign country and I would have never been wiser.  Area schools performed shows written especially for high schools (like "Mississippi Melody" and "Up On Old Smokey").  In 1971, I had just purchased a state-of-the-art reel to reel tape recorder and was anxious to do a bit of experimentation with it.  As fate would have it, I saw an ad on CBS for the 1971 Tony Awards telecast and thought I'd see what kind of sound quality I would get from the tinny little speaker on the television.  I had no idea the format for that year was to perform 1 song from each award-winning show using as many of the original cast members as possible.  Even though the sound quality was far less than perfect, I realized I had an audio tape of more original cast members singing songs from Broadway shows than I could shake a stick at.  And many of the songs were familiar from television variety shows like Ed Sullivan etc.  

I went away to college taking my recording with me and thoroughly annoyed my dormmates with it.  It was good to listen to while cleaning my room--but I had the advantage that I could recall what was on the television screen.  Reel-to-reel fell by the wayside for 8-track, cassette tapes, and finally cd.  The tape became brittle and would break many times over and electronic manufacturers slowly pulled reel-to-reel from the market.  Now, 30 years later, I'm actually seeing the performances again (remember this was YEARS before home video recordings).  The 1971 broadcast is heavily used throughout Broadway's Lost Treasures I, II and III.  The telecast that year used the giant lighted years as the backdrop for the songs.  Plus I found out that things like a "clunk" in the audio of "If I Were A Rich Man" was not caused by me--but it was Zero Mostel hitting the stage wagon with his shoe.  

One performance I can recall in particular that has not been used (yet) is the one where the female announcer says:  "...then came the sparkling 'High Button Shoes' and every bit as lovely then as she is now:  Nanette Fabray..."  (So I guess there's still enough material out there for "Broadway's Lost Treasures IV").  

Get all 3 dvds for your collection because it's nice to have something when you simply want to be entertained and don't want to be bothered with a story line.

Mandy Patinkin was shown only in one small part of "Evita."
That was very disappointing and I thought by the title he would be one of the hosts or at least a larger segment of him in "Evita." So why was he advertised in the title? The show was put together very well and the quality of the color and the production is excelent. It had a 3D effect which is very prominent, especially, with the hosting of Jerry Orbach.
The shows chosen were all of my favorites and so I was pleased with that part of the CD.  But not enough of Mandy Patinkin.
I don't think that you should advertise this CD by using Mandy's name as a come on. It sure fooled me.

I ordered this DVD when it first came out and I've been enjoying it ever since. All the performances are enjoyable- some more than others, but they are all wonderful nonetheless. Some of my pesonal favorites include:
    Patti Lupone bringing down the house along with Mandy Patinkin and Bob Gunton doing the song "A New Argentina" from Evita. This is definately one of my top 5 favorites on this DVD.
    Anegela Lansbury providing a hilarious performance in "The worst Pies in London" from Sweeny Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street
    Carol Channing singing the nothing-less-than inspirational "Before the Parade Passes By" from Hello, Dolly!
    Yul Brynner performing "Shall We Dance?" with his co-star (not sure of her name). This performance is priceless and so is that dress!
    John Raitt's beautiful baritone voice soars in this song-"Hey There" from The Pajama Game
    Paul Lynde delivers a ton of laughs in "Kids" from Bye Bye Birdie
    Joel Grey and cast perform the spectacle that is Cabaret in the song "Willkommen". This song never gets out of your head!
    Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera- two of Broadway's top leading ladies come together and perform two wonderful songs from Chicago: "All That Jazz" and "Nowadays". Bob Fosse's coreography can never get old and is dispalyed in this performance for your full enjoyment.
    Jerry Orbach. His death was a tragic loss to the theater. That's why these DVD's are so remarkable. This is another top performance- the song "Lullaby of Broadway" from 42nd Street. It was this performance that inspired me to save up and go to NYC to see my very first broadway show- 42nd Street.
    Andrea McArdle and the orphans perform "Tomorrow" and "You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile" from Annie. This is just superb. There's absolutely no flaws.
    Betty Buckley and cast perform two songs from Cats-"Jellicle Songs" and the classic "Memory". It is stunning to watch.
    Any performance with Patti LuPone in it is a gem in itself. This one- "Buenos Aires" from Evita shows off her powerful set of pipes and shows the other side of the character of Eva Peron.
    Bonnie Franklin and cast are hilarious in the song
"Applause" from the show Applause. The whole theme to the song is 100% true and kind of "hits home" for every actor. Plus, it has parodies of other classic musicals that will have you rolling on the floor in laughter if you're a big fan of musicals.
    All in all, this DVD is totally worth buying! And after you're through with this one and have memorized all the songs, check out Broadway's Lost Treasures II. I have yet to receive III, but I am looking forward to it!

I was at the '71 Tony Awards, broadcast in March of 1971, and I thought the marvelous night would have to live on in my memory.  And, then, lo and behold...we get this marvelous record of theater history.  Many of the performances were from the '71 broadcast..Zero Mostel, John Raitt, Robert Preston, Carol Channing, which was the Silver Anniversary of the Tony's, full of legendary performances from the history of the musical theater.  I'm so looking forward to the other DVD's of performances that were not included.  If you want to see the legends of Broadway perform their signature songs, then this is the tape for you

If you're a fan of musical theatre, you're almost guaranteed to find something you like on this DVD. Although the presentation is cheesy (with some awful bluescreen effects), the musical numbers themselves are entertaining.

Highlights include Patti LuPone in Evita, Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera in Chicago and Bonnie Franklin in Applause. But for me, as a fan of both the musical theatre and science fiction, the higlight was seeing a young Nana Visitor (Major Kira on Star Trek Deep Space Nine) dance her little heart out in an impressive dance number from My One and Only. In this particular number, you will also see a less than comfortable Twiggy trying to keep up with the rest of the dancers. She looks so out of place next to Tommy Tune.

One of the few performances I didn't like was Betty Buckley singing Memory from Cats. Her singing was okay, but I just didn't buy her as a "cat"...

Other than that, this DVD should warm the hearts of musical lovers around the world

It is very exciting to see these performances for the first time. I am more of a fan of Wicked and Hairspray but this was great! Too good to be true. I could have skipped the talking in between as it seemed forced and this is really one you buy just to see these stars doing what they are famous for. I love Mandy Patinkin and wish they still made musicals so he could be doing more of them in movies. Where was he in "Chicago"? I mean Richard GERE?

"The Living Daylights" is actor Timothy Dalton's first outing as the British super spy. He replaced Roger Moore, whom I regretfully have never seen in a Bond film. Actually, I've only seen 3 Bond films prior to this one.
(Thunderball, You Only Live Twice, and Diamonds are Forever). One thing most Bond fans agree on is that Sean Connery was the best James Bond.
I'd say that's accurate, but Dalton's approach to the character is far different from what we've previously seen. James Bond is, overall, an under developed character. He's a super-spy who loves martinis and women. In the films I've seen, James Bond is given no back story and shows little human emotion. Don't get me wrong, in this film there's no back-story either...But there is a little emotion. Anyway, the film has a great opening sequence; But, as usual, this sequence has little to do with the rest of the plot. It's merely used to get the audiences pumped for the rest of the story. The story involves Bond being hired as a sniper to protect a Russian officer named Georgi Koskov. Koskov is afraid that he is being targeted by a sniper; Bonds orders are to shoot any sniper he sees that poses a threat to Koskov. Well, Bond does see a sniper. Only the sniper is in the form a beautiful cellist named Kara (Maryam d'Abo, a really hot Bond girl). Making a last minute decision, Bond opts not to kill Kara and instead just wounds her. He then transports Koskov to a remote hiding spot. Koskov is then abducted from his hiding place and it's up to Bond to find him. As he does, with Kara's help of course, he uncovers a semi-complex weapons scheme. The plot is really nothing special, overall, but back to Dalton. In the previous Bond films, Bond usually woos a Bond girl and beds her. In this film, Bond seems to fall in love with her. Of course, there's no exchange of "I Love You" here; But the romance is a little different. The action sequences are good and the art direction is fantastic. It's nice to Bond in a normal place, like a fair. The scene where Bond and Kara have to escape from an Afghanistan prison is exciting. The film does have it's spot where it lags, but this is a worthy entry in the series. Hell, it's just nice to see a different side of James Bond. Another thing this film does is show a little more skin then you're used too. All the other Bond films use mere sexual innuendo; In this film, you actually side-nipple. 

GRADE: B+

The strong plot deals with a nasty agreement between a weapon ` mercenary and a Russian General, both of them are engaged in a dark red of corruption and illegal trades. Bond will have to face them until unmasking.

This saga is loaded with admirable sequences, fabulous landscapes and an intriguing script. The first incursion of Timothy Dalton was very gratifying, because at last Bond returns to his origins, far from being a simple Cartoon character since Moore was hired.

Recommended without reserves.

I'm sure folks getting into Bond just skip by this one coz Dalton only did two films, and the assumtion is that his movies must suck if he only lasted for two.  Though Dalton isn't given much praise, I think he's quite good.  In fact, to date I have not seen a lousy Bond actor.  Each actor had something unique to contribute.  Dalton is alot more serious, which probably seemed like a shock after people had spent a decade with the comical Roger Moore.  Dalton makes a quip here and there, and of course he's required to in the scenes with Q.  Otherwise, in situations where Moore would have definitely had a sarcastic remark, Dalton remains silent.  Another thing-both Roger and Sean(and George for that matter) were a couple of horndogs-Dalton doesn't even seem that interested in women!  Aside from scoring a chick in the precredit sequence, Dalton looks as though he's ready to settle down with the lead actress!  Bond is up against a weasely Russian and a psycho arms dealer played by Joe Don Baker(Mitchell!!).  John Rhys-Davies gets thrown into the mix too.  It may not be quite as cool as License To Kill, but don't pass it by

For all the annoyance Roger Moore caused many Bond fans, he was still the face of Bond for 15 years, and became our comfortable successor to the role originally helmed by Connery.  Now that he FINALLY bowed out (after nearly decomposing in OCTOPUSSY and VIEW TO A KILL), the challenge was on to find the NEW James Bond.  Many hoped Pierce Brosnan would step into the role at this point, but alas he was still obligated to being Remington Steele on TV.  Somehow or other, Timothy Dalton got the role - a very odd choice indeed in that he never seemed to really even WANT the part!  Indeed, I would have to grudgingly argue that Dalton is my least favorite James Bond - he just never seemed to own the role the way his other peers did (even Lazenby in his ONE outing).  

However, and ironically, his two films were some of the best the series had to offer, beginning with this definite Top Five contender.  TLD represented a return to the more espionage centered feel of the novels, and really only seen in the first two Connery films, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, and Moore's own FOR YOUR EYES ONLY.  The main plot revolves around a power-hungry arms dealer and a secondary plot to assassinate secret agents around the world.   Along the way, Bond hooks up with a would-be assassin and has one of his few on-screen monogamous relationships.  This alone adds to the believability of the film.

Somehow, the producers were able to delve into a rich espionage plot, yet still not skimp on the action.  This film is LOADED with action, including a new gadget-filled car (one of the better ones) and several exciting sequences involving the theft and eventual crash of a transport plane.  

The only complaint I have with this film (aside from Dalton himself) is that the villain is pretty weak.  Joe Don Baker just doesn't have the screen presence to be a villain.  Ironically, he returns in GOLDENEYE and TOMORROW NEVER DIES as a good-guy, and fits THAT role much better! Jerome Krabb fairs a little better, but is generally more annoying than anything else.

Marayam D'abo is nice as the Bond girl - attractive AND a good actress as opposed to the usual glamour models that may or may not be able to act (ahem - Barbara Bach - ahem).  This was the first Bond to replace Moneypenny - and the actress chosen was serviceable, but with little of the memorable flair that Samantha Bond has brought to the role in the recent Brosnan films.

All-in-all, and Dalton not-withstanding, this is one of the best of the series, and is a welcome return to a grittier and more believable Bond - Dalton's follow up, LICENSE TO KILL would delve even deeper into the gritty side of Bond - too bad the Brosnan films came along and took us back into Super Bond territory!

This is without a doubt my favorite movie out of the series.  The Living Daylights is a Bond film that has depth and realism.  The film isn't the typical Bond movie.  It has a hardcore spy plot.  Other films in the series like this includes FRWL and OHMSS.  As an actor Timothy Dalton brought intensity and passion to the role. No other Bond has reacted to situations with human qualities like Dalton did.  For example,  in the fair scene Dalton jumps up abruptly with anger and ready to kill when he finds out that Saunders was murdered. Previous Bonds did not show emotion like this(with the exception of George Lazenby). Dalton's performance made the movie transcend the title of being "just a Bond movie".  In some Bond films (especially the Bronsnan entries) the gadgets, the action, the jokes, and the escapades overpower the movie's  plot.  That is not the case with The Living Daylights.  There is a balance between action and plot.  The humor is witty without taking away from the serious nature of the film.  After watching Roger Moore's parody and silliness it was refreshing to watch Dalton take a darker approach in The Living Daylights.  Dalton's monogamous approach also made the film stand out.  Throughout the film Bond stayed with one woman-Kara Millovy (The pre-credits woman doesn't count).  Also, an important aspect to me in a Bond film is a believable down-to-earth villain.  This film accomplished just that.  Necros, Yogi, and Brad Wittiaker made classic intelligent villains.  Cartoonish villains such as Jaws make me disgusted with the series.  In conclusion, if you want parody from a Bond movie watch entries like The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, The Man With the Golden Gun, and Diamonds are Forever. However, if you want to watch a Bond movie with substance watch this movie, License to Kill, From Russia With Love, Thunderball, and On Her Majesty's Secret Service

This was the first Bond film I ever watched, years ago when it premiered on ABC saturday night movies, so I have a soft spot for it. It's still definitely one of the best, with an intriguing plot that actually requires the viewer to pay attention without becoming too convoluted. Probably the most spy-centric story since From Russia With Love. Timmothy Dalton's take on 007 is the grittiest of all the Bond actors so far, and he manages to find a strong balance between realism and the larger-than-life antics of Bond. All the usual Bond trimmings are here too, including the cars, gadgets, John Barry score, and even a new actress as Moneypenny. There are some fantastic action sequences including the opening teaser, a car chase on ice, and a fight on a cargo plane. Dalton only made two 007 films before the series went on hiatus, and this is the stronger of the two. It lacks the dark tone that haunts his follow-up, Licence to Kill, and feels a bit more timeless. 

This is also a pretty good DVD. You get a making-of documentary, another documentary on Bond creator Ian Fleming, the retro A-Ha music video of the title song, and a fun deleted scene (probably cut as it seems like a bit of silliness leftover from the Moore years). The bad? No English subtitles, at least on my version. My version also lacks the original burned-in subtitles on an early sequence where a Russian agent seduces her supervisor to provide Bond with a distraction. It's a rather funny one-liner, and I heard MGM corrected this mistake on later pressings of the disc. The Living Daylights still remains one of my favourite Bond films, and is a must-buy for all fans.

This is by far the best non-Connery Bond film.  Timothy Dalton is brilliant in the lead role, giving Bond a menacing quality. It is a shame we only got to enjoy him as 007 in two films, because he was truly awesome.  As far as the basic standards for Bond movies, this one delivers the goods; beautiful women, explosions, car chases, exotic locations...the works! And, AND, we get to see James Bond and Miriam D'Abo skiing down a mountain in a cello case! What else could you want

A New Bond with a New Style

The mystery of how well the new Bond would replace Roger Moore in the fifteenth "official" Bond movie was over with "The Living Daylights."  The style of the movie was set with the opening scenes, where three double-0 agents parachute onto Gibraltar as part of an infiltration exercise.  Unfortunately, someone in the exercise is using real ammunition, not paint balls.  Timothy Dalton shows that he is made of Bond material as he jumps onto an escaping jeep and fights with the bad guy as the jeep full of explosives catches fire, flies off a cliff, and explodes, with Bond having departed in a typically clever fashion but moments before the fireball erupts.

Timothy Dalton was a no-nonsense Bond in this movie.  He eliminated the numerous one-liners that seemed to be a Roger Moore characteristic in favor of a leaner and meaner and much more spy-like Bond.  In this first of two Bond movies Dalton had yet to achieve the presence and technique of either Sean Connery or Roger Moore, but he breathed new life into the series.

The plot bears some characteristics of "A View to a Kill" in that both films portray the Soviet Union as a friendlier nation beset with evil doers who would take advantage of the kinder, gentler, Soviet Union.  This time the criminals are looking to do a novel sort of bait and switch, profiting by buying drugs from Afghanistan and selling them in the Soviet Union.  Unfortunately, the money belongs to the Soviet Union.

Mixed into this plot is a Soviet defector, KGB General Koskov (Jeroen Krabb).  Bond's mission was to get Koskov out of East Germany and into Berlin.  However, it appears that someone wants Koskov dead, as a beautiful assassin attempts to kill Koskov as he attempts to defect.  Bond has a chance to kill Kara Milovy, well played by Maryam d'Abo, but he elects to shoot the gun from her hand instead.

The plot thickens during the debrief of Koskov.  Koskov tells British agents that General Leonid Pushkin, played by always excellent actor John Rhys-Davies, is executing a program to eliminate Britain's secret agents.  Unfortunately, KGB appears to retrieve Koskov from the English estate safe house and the British agents are unable to learn more.  Bond turns to Kara Milovy.  Bond leads Kara to believe he is going to get her out of the country to meet Koskov, her patron.  However, Bond has yet to learn where Koskov is.

What follows is an action-packed movie that is nicely plotted and interesting to the end.  There is an excellent battle scene in Afghanistan (filmed in Morocco), and an even better escape scene from Afghanistan.  After all that action there remains one loose end to tie up, which Bond does nicely.

During the film we meet another excellent supporting actor, Art Malik as Kamran Shah, an Afghani chief.  We also meet Joe Don Baker as self-centered Brad Whitaker.  There is yet another version of Felix Leiter, this time a less than memorable version of Leiter.  Caroline Bliss is a mediocre version of Miss Moneypenny.

The special effects were much more down-to-earth versus those in "A View to a Kill."  The ubiquitous Aston-Martin returns with rockets, rocket boost, outriggers, and sundry other gadgets.  There is a sliding glass door used as a weapon by an assassin.  The same assassin also uses a headset as an assassination tool.  This film also featured exploding milk bottles.  The way Koskov escapes from East Germany is excellent for at least a couple of reasons, including the use of a Harrier vertical takeoff jet.  In general the special effects were well done and believable.

There are a few moments where I noticed some scene glitches.  It appeared that in the final scenes of the movie that there were places where the four-engine C-130 Bond was flying had two engines.  In another scene in the plane Bond looks out the left window and we see fuel leaking from a tank.  However, the bullet holes are on the opposite side of the tank from the window.  Perhaps Bond also has x-ray eyes.  In yet another scene Kara drives a jeep up the ramp of the C-130, which is impossible due to the configuration of the C-130's ramps.  However, these minor errors can be forgiven as the quality of the rest of the movie is excellent.

The special edition DVD includes a deleted scene where Bond rides a flying carpet.  I will leave you to discover how that stunt was performed.  The reason given for its deletion was the length of the movie.

Keeping with the trend of having current musical artists perform the title song, A-Ha sings "Living Daylights."  A-Ha was popular in Europe at the time, and had a huge hit in the United States with "Take on Me."

There is irony in that the James Bond films are filmed in the same country that is the origin of Dr. Who.  One could start to think that James Bond is like Dr. Who, incarnating as different people over time.  Timothy Dalton was the fourth "official" Bond.  Each of the Bonds has had their own style and abilities, and each have generally been well exploited.  Fortunately for viewers, Timothy Dalton's Bond was a more austere Bond, living up to the tradition of the Ian Fleming novels.  He was smart, athletic, and confident without being arrogant.  This Bond movie remains above average for the genre, and enjoyable to watch multiple times.

I didn't watch this one before
Because of all the hype
Too many buddy comedies
Were coming through the pipe

This one caught me by surprise
It really was first rate
Two dudes who're crashing weddings
So they'll always have a date

Fast-talking party animals
With very rigid rules
Break it off before sunrise
Commitment's just for fools

Until one day one falls in love
The other falls in lust
If you want to see Vince Vaughn get hurt
Then this one is a must

Sometimes sappy, sometimes sweet
and often lewd and loud
but it doesn't stoop to flatulence
so it stands out from the crowd

"Wedding Crashers" starts off slow, I thought it was going to be a disaster of a movie, but I was wrong. By the end, the story became very interesting and was very fun to watch. Yeah, this movie is overhyped a little, but it is still a really good movie. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are raally great in their roles on this film. It's not a film you have to really think about, it is just a good comedy.

I watched this flick while planning my wedding and enjoyed it so much I've been tempted to try it...kind of sorry nobody crashed mine! 

Great romantic comedy. THe added features, which include Chaz' Rules Of Wedding Crashing, make this DVD well worth the buy

The opening sequence with Dwight Yokum and Rebecca De Mornay is one of the funniest in the film. The rest doesn't live quite up to it. The movie suffers from an improbability problem. I know from working weddings like some they went to, it's not easy to sneak into a wedding, especially high profile weddings with bouncers and giant men standing at the doors looking at your invite!

Besides that, I will say I enjoyed the film. It's not as funny as say, 40 Year Old Virgin, but there's some good stuff in there. Keir O'Donnell has some of the funniest moments in the film as the goth/artist/gay son of Walken. These were some of the laugh out loud moments of the film.

Owen Wilson is very likable in the film as the partier-coming-to-grips with his age and wanting more out of life. He more or less plays the straight man to Vince Vaughn's antics.

Vaughn speaks in lightening fast dialogue most of the movie. Funny, and good, but at times I was left scratching my head. He's a strong actor and makes strong choices in this movie.

The directing by Dobkin sometimes feels less than good. Desk scenes shot with 2 cameras make it look like the actors are improvising most of their lines and leaves these "buddies" looking a bit too disconnected.

Bottom Line: If you enjoy comedies, especially of this genre, see it. It is very formulatic and if you're smart, you'll know how it ends about 30 minutes into this overly long comedy. (over 2 hours)

PS: Will Ferrell turns in a very odd performance as Chazz Reinhold the ultimate wedding crasher. You might feel a little dirty after watching this near out of place character.

The Wedding Crashers is one of the modern breed of rom-coms (along with Hitch) that actually appeals to men as well as women. The formula is simple, amuse the guys by showing the male lead as a chauvenistic womaniser, then please the chicks by having him turn into the gushing romantic hero who falls for the female star. It basically means juvenile toilet humour for the first half of the film before the transition into unrealistic gushing soppy romance that never actually happens in real life in the second half. I enjoyed it, but it does get a bit sappy towards the end

I have many books about digital sports photography and they don't even come close to this DVD in regard to practical application.  The title of this DVD is so on target.  It is 'simple' to use the settings suggested and it pays off immediately.  This is an excellent DVD and well worth the cost.  (I wish the same people made one about digital portrait photography.)  To ALL Parents of Athletes: BUY THIS DVD. Only buy the books if you want to go into professional sports photography.

Teaching photography I have seen quite a few how-to videos, and this one is the best so far. It is well thought-out and produced. It takes the view point of an amateur photographer (Mom and/or Dad photographing the kids playing various sports), but has many concepts that could just as easily apply to professionals. Equipment wise he does expect a digital SLR with a minimum of a 200mm lens. Sorry no point-and-shoots allowed. Otherwise I would highly recommend this video

I'm new to using an SLR and this DVD was the perfect training video.  This video tells you what equipment you need, how to set it up, where to position yourself, and how to shoot for the best results.  With my new camera and this information, I immediately was able to produce good shots during basketball and baseball games.  

Well worth the money

Of all the instruction and training I've received over the years, I thought this was one of the best, if not the best, instructional DVDs I've ever seen. Doug Jensen has really set the bar. Every aspect of it was extremely well done - scripting, structure, use of stills and video, video camera work (I'm a video producer myself, so I paid particular attention to that) audio (often a weak point in DVDs) and the use of graphics (I really liked the 'through the viewfinder' parts - where sports action video is shown framed in a SLR viewfinder) - even the glossary was helpful in reviewing terms and also the explanation of the digital photo histogram. Plus, it was loaded with tons of practical tips and advice - the kind of things that a really experienced photographer tells you one-on-one, when they want to help you out. For someone like me who is transitioning from a film 35mm SLR to digital SLR - it was really helpful to clarify the concept of EV (Exposure Value) and the interplay of ISO, shutter and aperture. Yeah, I knew what they were - but to see the relationship "in action" and how it changes from shutter priority to aperture priority (depending on the shot) really reinforced the concepts. If you buy only one resource for digital sports photography - this should be it. It has a permanent place in my DVD reference library

 I love this movie. It came out a couple of years after I personally had some what of the same experiences. I had a baby when I was 15 and my boyfriend and I split up for a short time then got back together and we are still together 20 years later (married at 17) so unlike what 'Rochelle O'Gorman' says (who gave the Editorial Review on this movie) teenage couples staying together is sometimes and can be a reality. I think it is a good moral story that shows it is possible to make it and stay together even when you do get together and have a baby young.

I have always loved this movie.  Too me it is a comfort movie because I have seen it so many times growing up.  I recently let my 13 year old neice watch it and she loved it too.  I didnt think she would like it that much because its a big time 80's flick but she loved it.  Now she wants to watch it everytime she comes over

Molly Ringwald shines in this film as she portrays a high school senior who ends up pregnant. She and the father get married and try to stick it out... she tries to work while pregnant, he tries to help his dad out... nothing seems to work. They get their own place and have to deal with their electricity being shut off so they end up moving in with her mother, which is difficult for everyone.
Molly's husband has gotten a scholarship to a prestigious school and he's willing to give it up to help her with the baby, but she doesn't want him to. In the end she just about forces him to take the scholarship and he does.
Mixed in with the humor and comedy, there is a great lesson on teen pregnancy and getting married young. It's harder than it looks and this is an excellent movie for young girls to watch and learn from

For Keeps where shall I start.  For Keeps is one of those 80's movies that would fit perfect on The Lifetime Network.  Molly Ringwald stars as Darci Elliot and Randall Batinkoff stars as Stan Bobrutz (intentional hard to spell and pronoucne name, it is the butt of several jokes in the film).  The two high school sweethearts are sent fast forward into adult hood when Darci becomes pregnant.  They struggle to stay together.  I think this film is great because it shows young people just how hard things can be when you introduce a baby into the picture.  It is not one of those happily ever after stories, Stan and Darci go through some real hard times.  The movie itself takes a real awkward turn towards the end with Darci pushing Stan to pursue his dreams without his knowledge, but the movie will entertain those in 6th grade and up.  Its a bit pricey but it is good for educational use and for the 80's fan building their collection

I've been told by many people that this show was an American Monty Python.  While it is slightly better than SNL (Bob Odenkirk, the co-creator of this series, rarely got any of his sketches on the air while he toiled at SNL, so this show was the result), it still isn't particularly funny.  The only sketches I liked were the "burger" commercial in Season One, the Iguana sketch (Odenkirk plays an Iguana very well), and the Jesus Christ Superstar parody is really good (though not particularly funny...just well shot and edited, it feels almost like a tribute).  But other sketches drag on and on (particularly the infomercial parody), and many feel forced.  The repartee between Cross and Odenkirk doesn't really work well either.  I tried to get into this show, but just couldn't.  Sorry...

I've been a Mr Show fan for decades. I saw Bob and David (not Dave) in concert in Twin Falls, Idaho back in 1989. They were a bit raw, but what they lacked in polish they made up for in sincerity and harmony. Some people want to call them the next Bob &amp; Ray or Rowan &amp; Martin or even Goldberg/Williams/Crystal. I say peeshaw! Bob has more talent in his ankle (left) than all of those jerks combined. And for David (not Dave), he's an example of how to live your life even when your body is being ravaged by HPV. I hope Lifetime will listen to its viewers and bring this back

I had never watched Mr. Show up  until a little over a year ago when they started playing it after midnite on TBS slightly edited.  I was hooked and began recording every episode on Tivo, until I realized they seemed to be edited so I picked up the 4th season and loved it, there were so many hilarious sketches on that thing, my favorite being the story of Everest.  I finally picked this up a few weeks ago and have watched it several times, and while I found myself laughing out loud often, I didn't find this to be as clever or funny as the 4th season, aside from one or 2 sketches, not too much really stick out like the majority of season four.  A must own if you're a true fan of the show, for the commentary alone

It could be argued that the brilliant and equally bizarre Mr Show, had a very limited, niche appeal...although I'm unsure as to why exactly. Well, that's not entirely true, as I have a pretty good idea of why that is...or was. 
Maybe the explanation lies within the inherent properties of average TV audiences being... well, why even delve into it, eh?

Allow me to slather on high praise: I miss Bob and Dave. 
Bob was recently doing some late-Friday-night-oddball-flick-hosty thing on Sundance Channel. In fact, it was there that I saw the movie he directed, "Melvin Goes To Dinner," which I enjoyed. But I digress...
Mr Show was original, intelligent, hysterical. Thank your lucky stars that the goodness of Mr Show's hijinks have been preserved in this format for you to enjoy whenever the mood strikes you.
Break this DVD out at a party and silently muse over the obtuse, slack-jawed faces. Y'all are truly brutalizin' me.

This is the fourth time I have watched this first and second season of Mr. Show, and I must admit, it is one of those rare programs that continues to get funnier and funnier each time that you watch it.  Literally, you catch something new and fresh each time it is placed inside of your DVD player.  What makes this series work better than most other television comedies out there is the chemistry of the cast.  Bob Odenkirk and David Cross are perfectly matched while also being completely random choices for the hosts of the show.  I had not heard about either of them before watching this series (which I bought due to a recommendation from a friend), now I have watched Melvin Goes to Dinner several times and listened to David Cross' stand-up comedy whenever I need a very social pick-me-up!  Needless to say, I have full submersed myself into their world after watching this groundbreaking series.

What continues to work with this program is that the jokes are not your typical slapstick humor that the average "Joe" can get from watching reruns of Friends on NBC.  Mr. Show is hard hitting, in your face, political, yet not so political, social satire about the world around us.  While you may just see this as just another comedy show, I see it as so much more.  The cohesiveness of the skits and the underlying message throughout each show seem to represent the voices that we hear coming from our local papers on a daily basis.  They are not afraid to take a delicate issue and twist it into a hysterical moment.  The brutal honesty of David Cross makes this show thoroughly enjoyable while the approachable Bob Odenkirk brings it to our level.  Also, the interweaving of comic geniuses throughout the show keeps you wanting more.  Jack Black is a regular on the program (and really proves why he is funny), and there are appearances by Dave Foley, Sarah Silverman, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Patton Oswalt, Julia Sweeney, Janeane Garofalo, Ben Stiller, Conan O'Brien, and Andy Richter.   This is not a show for everyone, but it does showcase the beauty of HBO and the ability that they have to see, and go forward, with avant-garde comedy. 

My favorite episodes were the News Report featured in the extras, Operation Hell on Earth, and If You're Going to Write a Comedy Scene, You're Going to Have Some Rat Feces in There, and the infamous milk machine joke song with Jack Black!   Utterly hysterical. (no pun intended)

This DVD set of the first and second seasons is packaged very well.  With every season uncensored (were they ever with HBO), you get Mr. Show as it should be and will always be remembered.  It also is chalked full of extras that will quench every drop of Mr. Show that resides in you.  The news report that they do in the extras portion of this DVD is worth buying alone.  Again, it shows the creativity and originality of a program that knew no boundaries.  I cannot wait to get my hands on the other seasons and fully explore the world in which I live ... which is the world showcased continually on Mr. Show.  The absurdity of our culture is redefined with this program.

Grade: ***** out of ****

I started watching Mr Show on HBO in it's 3rd season on HBO and loved it.  I ran accross the DVD for seasons 1 &amp; 2 together and in a fit of nostalgia decided to get it.  It was on of the best DVD purchases I've ever made.  These men are geniuses, although not everybody gets their brand of comedy.  It was fun seeing Jack Black on one of the early episodes as well

My favorite movie is The Diary of Anne Frank. (1959). 

Why? This is a movie about a 13 year old girl and her family that hides with her family and 4 other people in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to escape from the Nazis during World War 2 because they are Jewish.

The characters consists of Mr., Frank, Mrs. Frank, their daughters  Margot and Anne. Then there are the Van Daans, and their son Peter. Also, there is a crabby old dentist. And they have the helpers, Mr. Kraler and Miep. They help the people in the secret annex get food and clothing. Later in the movie, Anne falls in love with Peter, the Van Daans' son. They tell each other everything. 

*Beware, at the end, Peter and Anne kiss a couple of times, and everybody is arrested and taken to conceratiain camps. Mr. Frank is the only survivor.

<review_text>

Restored to its original 180 minute roadshow length (including overture and exit music), George Stevens' CinemaScope production of THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK (1959, Fox) is a deeply moving and superbly acted movie experience.  Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett adapted their Broadway show, with a brilliant Joseph Schildkraut  (Otto Frank) and Gusti Huber (Mrs. Frank) repeating their stage roles.  Added to a great cast are a very poignant and natural young Millie Perkins as Anne, Oscar winner Shelley Winters, Oscar nominee Ed Wynn in a bitter dramatic role, Diane Baker, and Richard Beymer as Anne's boy friend.

It is heartrending material--a German Jewish family hiding out from the Nazis for two years in a Dutch attic, with Anne keeping a daily diary that was curiously ignored by the Nazis and has become one of the most important Holocaust documents.  (Maybe the same God who unforgivably let Anne and her sister die in a concentration camp only one month before war's end helped hide her diary for posterity.)  Location filming was done in the actual Amsterdam attic, with the real Otto Frank as technical advisor.  The Oscar-winning B&amp;W art direction re-creates the actual two story attic interior to perfection (on huge Fox sound stages), and Oscar-winning cinematographer William Mellor (PEYTON PLACE) worked miracles to make wide CinemaScope compositions look cramped and claustrophobic. Producer/director Stevens gives it all a nail-biting tension, even though we know the grim outcome because of the powerful opening and closing framing device.

Bonus material is outstanding--a feature-length documentary "Echoes From the Past." new interviews with George Stevens, Jr. (who was second-unit director in Amsterdam) and a still-beautiful 66 year old Millie Perkins, and Movietone Newsreel footage.  You will need two evenings for this film masterpiece that was nominated for eight Oscars the same year as SOME LIKE IT HOT, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, BEN-HUR, and ANATOMY OF A MURDER.  That was some movie year!  DIARY OF ANNE FRANK is an unforgettable Holocaust drama and movie experience when you have a three hour time slot.

Detached as I am when watching movies, this one truly grabbed my heart and never stopped squeezing, the juice pouring out of my eyes in the form of sympathetic tears.

This movie is great in all departments--acting, writing, directing, and editing. Based on some of the previous reviews, I expected an amaturish performance from Millie perkins. No way. She was wonderful, expressing the gamut of teenage emotions and evoking from me a caring, understanding response. Her only weakness is in her voice-over narration--it's a bit stiff, never transcending the sense of someone reading rather than just talking naturally. But this this is greatly overshadowed by the subtleties of her acting, which absorbed me thoroughly. 

THIS IS A MOVIE WORTH SEEING MANY TIMES--SO ABSORBING IS THE STORY AND THE CHARACTERS

This is a beautiful and very touching dramatization about a gifted, young German Jewish girl whose family had to go into hiding in order to avoid being captured and killed by the Nazis. The characters of Miep Gies and Kraler--Otto Frank's co-workers who hid the family at this horrible time and place--are very, very positive, as well. The film stars Millie Perkins (Anne Frank,) Richard Beymer as Peter Van Daan,) Ed Wynn (Dussel) and Shelley Winters (Mrs. Van Daan) who won an award for this as best supporting actress. All were absolutely brilliant. The film is a work of art that won several academy awards. I cannot recommend highly enough this remarkable and brilliant work--as positive and human as Anne herself.

While millions of unfortunate people were marched off to Nazi death camps during World War II, the Franks and the Van Daans savored their moment in hiding until they were discovered in August 1944 after an informer had tipped off the SS. Millie Perkins played the title role of Anne Frank, a girl in her teens who wished for a happy life and did her best to bring happiness to her family during a tumultuous time in the course of history.

In the two years the eight people were cooped up in a secret hideout on the top floor of a building located in the heart of Amsterdam, Anne kept up with her education and had the dream of one day to become a writer. She began writing a diary of her daily experiences of what she learned in life and how she coped with the boredom while in hiding. She had a courtship with Peter Van Daan as their relationship grew stronger toward the end when the SS broke through the secret entrance arresting all eight people.

Anne died of typhus within two months of Nazi Germany's surrender while interned at the infamous Bergen-Belzen death camp. Her father, Otto, was the only one of the eight to survive the Holocaust, returning to the former hideout where he found his daughter's diary to have it published. He resided in Canada until his death in the 1980s.

I visited the Anne Frank Museum in Amsterdam during the summer of 1977 before seeing this film for the first time the following year. Seeing the layout of the actual hiding place, I could picture how everything was while watching the film. Though a part of history, reflecting back to that dark era is painful for some people who had experienced the Holocaust and Nazi persecutions. Someone once said of the Nazi era that it is the things we want to forget most that we try the hardest to remember.

For those of you who may be reluctant to buy this because of the specifications listed on the back of the box, let me set your mind at ease.  While the box states Widescreen format (Aspect Ratio 2.35:1), it is actually anamorphically (16x9) enhanced.  And even though it states English stereo, it is actually dolby digital 4.0  There is no English mono or Spanish and French language tracks.  And the commentary track includes Millie Perkins even though she's not listed.  The movie looks beautiful and sounds great

My new year's resolution was to see a bunch of movies I'd always intended to see but continually seemed to miss.  Somewhat belatedly I'm fulfilling my resolution, which is why I finally saw WESTWORLD.  Although it was somewhat dated, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this.  The film concerns Delos, a resort of the future that allows guests to visit either of three theme parks where behavior that is frowned upon in the modern world can be engaged in without repercussion.  Guests engage in orgiastic sex, feasting and heavy drinking, and the killing of opponents just for the sheer fun of it.  One can choose between doing this in Roman World, Medieval World, or Westworld.  The film focuses primarily on two visitors to Westworld, played by Richard Benjamin and James Brolin.  This was one of the last Sci-fi films made before the onset of the personal computer, yet one of the first to actually utilize computers in the making of it.  According to one book I recently read, the CGI representing the vision field of the The Gunslinger robot was the first use of computers to generate images in film history.  So, in this way it could be considered cutting edge.  On the other hand, when things start going wrong with a number of the robots, the head of technology on Delos describes the ailment as a "disease."  Today we'd obviously describe this as a virus in their software.  

"Westworld" is clearly the stock Warner Brothers Western set that was used at approximately the same time by BLAZING SADDLES.  This works well for the film for it gives the viewer an image that seems weirdly familiar (though understandably familiar, since it has been used in dozens of movies and hundreds of television episodes).  So the visitors to the park get pretty much the Western experience prior media would have conditioned them to expect.  Even the bad guys seem familiar.  Yul Bryner, for instance, wears the exactly same outfit that he wore when he starred in THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.  The visitors quickly fall into the routine, James Brolin doing an obvious imitation of Clint Eastwood and Richard Benjamin quickly breaking out of the mold of somewhat nerdy lawyer.  They visit the local brothel, kill the robot played by Yul Bryner a couple of times, get arrested and break out of jail and shoot the sheriff, and get drunk in the middle of a huge brawl.  Then things go wrong on a major scale, with the robots going on a killing spree.  The highpoint of the film is the long chase of Richard Benjamin by Yul Bryner.  

A remake of WESTWORLD is currently in development.  I am normally opposed to remakes.  For the most part remakes are pale imitations of the originals, even in the case of most Sci-fi films.  The remakes of THE INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS were inferior to the original, while the original PLANET OF THE APES is vastly superior to the remake.  But this is one instance where, if done correctly, a remake could improve upon the original.  The film is well done, but it was made well before computers came to dominate cultural life.  As a result, the computerized control room looks absurdly primitive.  For instance, there are no keyboards, but only consoles with buttons and switches and knobs.  The danger, of course, is going overboard with the special effects.  The temptation all too often is to go overboard with CGI and spectacular effects; in such cases story is sacrificed for spectacle.  My hope is that they will keep this under control and keep enhancements at a minimum.

All in all, this was a very enjoyable and different Sci-fi film.  It was directed and written by Michael Crichton and I couldn't help but think throughout it how similar the overall premise was to another Crichton creation:  JURASSAIC PARK.  Both deal with things going wrong at technologically advanced theme parks.  Substitute dinosaurs for robots or vice versa and you have essentially the same movie.

special effects have come along way from 1974 when westworld first came out,but this little gem still hangs head and shoulders above most sci-fi entertainment.
      welcome to delos,vacation spot of the future,where you can have a once and a lifetime fantasy come true. you may choose westworld,romanworld,and meadevilworld! you can,for $1000.00 a day(1974 prices) you can live out your most secert fantisies.it's all set up to please you and you can't get hurt. of course if that were true then we have no movie. soon after the latest batch of people get to the park,the robots begin to have breakdowns,like a virus(i still remember the reviews calling the idea of computers getting viruses as "to far out there,no one will believe it" wonder if they still think so). james brolin and richard benjemin are two friends enjoying westworld when the whole park goes on the blink and the robots start to kill thr guest.
  the final chase(with evil robot yul brynner,still dressed as chris from his stint in the maganfict seven cloths)is very thrilling and the whole movie has the feel of a park ride gone bad. a very fun movie

A bit campy in spots, a bit ahead of its time in others, Westworld looms as a potential goldmine for trilogy-happy Hollywood.  Introduce an all-star cast at the beginning, split them up to the three different worlds, and end the first film with the characters escaping their grisly fate... only to find themselves in Medieval World.  Repeat formula for the second part, adding in the characters who went off to that park, then shunt the survivors off to join the rest at Roman World for the big third film finale.  Seriously, why is somebody not making this already

I watched this with my 6 year old daughter last night.  She was into it (with her short attention span) for the whole film.  One pleasant surprise...it has a pretty good chase scene.  I like chase scenes.    Any SF fan will welcome this in his/her collection.
A few good comic shots.  Watch Richard Benjamin struggle to get into the saddle during the Jail break.

I WANT THE TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK!
After all the talk about what a cult classic this film is! What a waste of time! Maybe this movie was a novelty to American moviegoers in 1973. That time is past (even then, the "robots attack people" concept was hardly new). Now this is just a boring B movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action. This film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes. Unless you are doing a research paper on American Sci-fi cinema, or you are in your 40s and enjoyed this movie as a kid, or you just like boring anticlimactic B movies, AVOID THIS DULL PIECE OF DRIVEL.
I FEEL CHEATED!

In the future, there is a special adult themepark called "Delos" which has three different area adventure worlds which are "Medieval World", "West World", and "Roman World" where realistic humanoid robots serve the guests with the vacation they will remember. Two Vacationers ( Richard Benjamin and James Brolin) has chosen Westworld where they can do anything they want but unfortunately as there's a malfuction the robots completely go bersek especially a deadly gunslinging robot ( Yul Bryner) who wants to kill them.

Amusing and fascinating Sci-fi thriller written and directed by the author of "Jurassic Park" Michael Crichton with some fine acting and good special effects for it's time. Yul Bryner himself steals the show as the bad guy who was an influence on "The Terminator", this has became a cult fave and one of the most interesting pre-Star Wars Sci-fi movies of that time and was parodied in the episode of the Simpsons called "Itchy and Scratchy Land".

The DVD has decent picture &amp; sound with only one extras which is the original trailer, but still this is a must have for anyone who likes Sci-fi.

Also recommended: Jurassic Park, Terminator 1 &amp; 2, Blade Runner, Tron, Robocop, I Robot, and Chopping Mall

Mark Wahlberg and Burt Reynolds star in this film centering on the heyday of the porn industry in the 70s and 80s.

Mark Wahlberg stars as Eddie Adams, a [..]bus boy working at a nightclub washing dishes.  One of the club's most frequent visitors is Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), a porn movie producer who comes to the club looking for new actors.  Rollergirl (Heather Graham) also works at the club and is one of Horner's most popular actresses.

One night, Jack goes into the back to talk to Eddie and soon the two become friends.  Jack tells Eddie all about the porn business, and Eddie is immediately intrigued.  Eddie has nothing to lose, since his parents threw him out of the house with just the clothes on his back.  Eddie accepts jack's invitation to act in one of his films and soon he is submurged in the world of [..] movies.

His costar in his first movie is Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), a very close friend of Jack's who lives in his house with him.  Eddie has a very successful session with Amber, and soon he sees his career begin to skyrocket.  Due to his new-found success, Eddie decides to change his name.  He settles on Dirk Diggler.

For several years, Dirk is living in the limelight, making lots of money, and filming lots of x-rated movies.  However, success begins to take its toll, and Dirk delves into the world of drugs and alcohol.  Dirk's hard-driving life catches up to him and he has a major falling-out with Jack, who has replaced him with a new main actor called Johnny Doe.  Dirk's downward spiral continues, and he and his best friend Reed Rothschild (John C. Reilly) are involved in a shoot-out with an over-drugged thug who likes to listen to Night Ranger music.

Dirk survives, but he realizes his life is a mess.  He decides to try to make amends with Jack, and Jack and Amber welcome him back with open arms.  After their reconcilliation, Dirk resumes his role as Jack's main star.

I thought this was a very good movie.  Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore, and Burt Reynolds give fine performances.  The plot is very good and does a good job of showcasing the porn industry at the height of its success.

I recommend this movie very highly.  Watch and get a feel for what it was like to be a porn star

'Boogie Nights' does for the disco seventies and the porn industry what 'Nashville' did to country music.  It shows the underside of the glamour presented.  The film shows us all the trappings that draw people to the "high life," then pulls the rug out from under it.  We see the usual suspects and the usual draws:  There's money, fame, lust, passion, and drugs.  But these benefits provide an understated banality that comes to the fore.  The seemingly long, drawn out conversations are only postcards of emotion that show the depth of personhood that seems to escape all of the protagonists.  It is superficial, and all of life's best elements seem to go out the window. 

There is the calculated cheesiness of the producer (Burt Reynolds) and his odd detatchment from his craft.  He both revels and drowns in the lust and money that are presented to him.  He meets a young aspiring hopeful (Mark Wallberg) who must overcome his poverty and alienation from home.  His naivete' is striking, and he doesn't entirely change in his innocence, only becoming a casualty of it.  (The way he practices to become the next Bruce Lee in the midst of his success as a novelty presentation is certainly a sad commentary about his life.)  His new success doesn't make him all that happy, including his rationalization that his movies are making marriages more passionate.  The aftermath of all the calculated lust makes everyone, except the calloused producer, a casualty in a different way.  One fellow porn star (Don Cheadle) demonstrates that his true passion is for a loving marriage and a hi-fi business, but the decent, conventional world won't let him.  Similarly, a fellow porn creator (William Macy) shows tragically that love transcends lust, even when it won't ever become realized.  A female porn star is devastated by her cocaine addiction and an inevitable result of a custody battle.  If we aren't convinced near the end of the movie, then a "candid camera" scene between "Rollergirl" and the man off the street certainly shows how the emotional baggage catches up to all of the porn industry's false promises for true happiness.

The initial draw to 'Boogie Nights' may be deceptive.  It presents the glamour of all that the modern world believes to be desirable, but cleverly shows how the lowest common denominator can restrict our lives from even greater happiness.

This is a movie loosely based on 70's and 80's porn star John Holmes. In this version, a young man name Eddie Adams is approached by porn director Jack Horner. Eddie then turns famouse and leads into a downward spiral including drugs and violence. This movie features many stars of the late 90's and today, including Mark Wahlberg as Eddie Adams, Burt Reynolds at Jack Horner, John C. Reilly as Reid Rothchild, and Julianne Moore as Amber Waves. Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore were nominated for oscars for their breakthrough performance. This movie was also nominated for Best Writing to Paul Thomas Anderson for an oscar.

The Extras on this DVD are good: 10 Deleted Scenes, a Music Video, 2 Commentary tracks, and the John C. Reilly Files

A film about the porn industry in the late 70's early 80's. Great Cast, Great Performances, Great Story, just a Great Film. Unique approach to the subject, characters that are flashy yet human with real emotion ,characters played by Julianne Moore, Don Cheadle, Heather Graham, William H. Macy, and Burt Reynolds respectfully, are great to watch. This is a performance piece

<review_text>
Given that pornography is a multi-jillion-dollar-a-year business, it's sort of surprising that it hasn't received the cinematic treatment more often, but Boogie Nights provides it with the sort of skewed, darkly comic treatment that it almost certainly deserves, and becomes a certifiable classic in the process.  Following the story of Eddie Adams, a simple-minded, almost impossibly well-endowed teenager from suburban California who achieves porn stardom as Dirk Diggler before turning 20, Boogie Nights is both a time-tested star-is-born-and-almost-blows-it-all story and a loving tribute to a time and place that will probably never be replicated and the individuals who made it what it was.  

Paul Thomas Anderson's directing is as excessive and stylish as you'd expect from a movie centered on the porno industry, with Anderson pulling out every trick in the book--long tracking shots, underwater closeups, montages, movie-within-a-movie views, and some moments that approach stream-of-consciousness (Dirk's vision of his professional name literally exploding off a neon sign being a prominent example).  Naturally, Anderson also loads the movie up with period details, right down to the Farah Fawcett poster in teenage Dirk's room, the platform shoes, and the obligatory disco sequences.  Its visual flair aside, though, Boogie Nights is also the sort of insanely quotable, watch-it-until-you've-memorized-it movie that seemed to come out in droves in the nineties (Trainspotting, Fargo, Goodfellas, Swingers, True Romance, etc. etc. etc.) but has been in disturbingly short supply this decade.  This movie simply seems to have everything you can think of going for it, especially its murderer's row of a cast--Burt Reynolds (Jack Horner), Don Cheadle (Buck Swope), John C. Reilly (Reed Rothchild), Julianne Moore (Amber Waves), William H. Macy (Little Bill), Luis Guzman (Maurice Rodriguez), Tom Jane (Todd Parker), Philip Baker Hall (Floyd Gondolli), Philip Seymour Hoffman (Scotty Jay), and Alfred Molina (Rahad Jackson) all figure prominently--and even Wahlberg (Dirk himself) and Heather Graham (Rollergirl) have roles that are perfectly suited to their relative limitations as actors.  

That said, what really gives the movie its resonance is the obvious sympathy with which it treats its characters, who are generally easy to laugh at but equally easy to like.  The main characters almost entirely have hopes, aspirations, and attachments beyond the rather closed world of their profession--Jack's desire to be a serious filmmaker; Dirk's ridiculous pseudo-Karate and Reed's equally ridiculous poetry; Buck's goal of opening his own stereo store; Amber's attempts to get back in touch with her son, which she blatantly compensates for by mothering her co-stars--helping us see them as fleshed-out characters, not just plot devices in the story.  

Since there isn't really a plot to speak of, the movie is told as a series of episodes, Goodfellas-style, with several extended pieces--the pool party at Jack's House where Eddie/Dirk gets introduced to the whole crew; the New Year's Eve party celebrating the start of the '80's; the fake drug deal gone bad at a Rahad's house--serving to turn the narrative in new directions.  This last set piece--when Dirk, Reed, and Todd head over to Rahad's house to sell him some baking soda disguised as cocaine and it quickly degenerates into a laughably misguided robbery attempt--deserves special mention, as it's easily one of the most fascinating single scenes in recent film memory.  It starts off almost surreal, with a skinny Chinese guy walking around randomly lighting firecrackers and Rahad (clad only in underwear, a bathrobe and slippers) discoursing semi-coherently as he sings along to not-so-classic 80's songs on a mixtape.  From there it just gets progressively darker and tenser, with the lighting, acting, and direction all perfectly serving to ratchet up the feeling of desperation and horror as Todd kicks his ill-conceived robbery plot into motion and things spin way out of control.  Molina's over-the-top performance, more than anything else, makes the scene, as he turns Rahad into a manic ball of drug-fuelled energy and, later, a shotgun-toting avenging angel determined to take his revenge.  I wouldn't say Molina turns in the best performance I've ever seen in a movie, but it it probably the best performance I've seen from someone who only got one scene in the whole movie.

The '80's are, of course, the hangover from the joys of the previous decade, as the emergence of video downgrades the quality of the product, cocaine suddenly becomes addictive, and Dirk starts to become too big for his britches in more ways than one.  Fittingly, as the disco era gives way to tougher times in the eighties, the movie takes a darker turn, becoming grittier, more downcast and a lot more violent, but no less compelling.  All the unbridled energy and creativity of the first half is still present, just in a decidedly less sunny form.  Even when people are getting beaten up and shot left and right, the movie's pedal-to-the-metal pacing makes it all but impossible to look away.  Well, except maybe for the notorious money shot at the end, but by then I for one didn't care.

The setting of this film is in the late 70s, just before adult movie theatres were driven out of business by the invention of the VCR and the subsequent explosion of pornographic VHS tapes.  Burt Reynolds plays a porno director who has the effrontry to try and be "artistic" in his craft.  Heather Graham plays his psycho-starlet, and Mark Wahlberg plays a porn star who is....well.....let's just say, endowed.

Wahlberg's character quickly becomes a huge hit and encounters success he would have never dreamed of. Wahlberg's character seems to be a sort of oblique allusion to John Holmes, although I don't know if the film-makers would admit as much.   At any rate, he becomes arrogant and begins to believe that he is loved for factors other than his "package."  This hubris leads to his un-doing as the world of porn coalesces with the world of drugs and LOTS of shady characters.

This sounds like it would be the framework for a good movie.  Well, it could have been, but all the way through there seems to be something missing.  There are times the film "seems" to try and convey a message, but I'm not really sure.  
 
One thing I do know is that I quickly remembered why I've never cared for Wahlberg.  He has all the screen presence of a bowl of yogurt.   Also, I was expecting a LOT more skin than what the film delivered.  Given the context of the film, one would think that it would be an excuse to parade miles of topless women.  That's simply not the case.

In the end, however, the biggest problem of this movie isn't Wahlberg or the lack of nudity.  The difficulty is that it's just plain boring.  I have more than a passing interest in the history of porn, and yet this flick failed to grab me

Yes, my mock Amazon name is Dirk Diggler(long story),
but this is "Boogie Nights".
I can't say this movie was "over-looked", because it wasn't. In fact it is really amazing that a film with this content was recognised for what it was and is, "Fan-f**k-ing-tastic".
Burt Reynolds is back at the top of his game in years, Marky Mark can act(Dirk himself), Heather Graham, and all the rest are in top form.
What can you say?? Kinda a mock story of John Holmes/70's/80's porn scene, but you really start to care about these people.
Soundtrack represents the time and it all just works.
I can't hear "Sister Christian" by Nightranger without thinking of that scene.(Some of you know, others will)
Get the New Line 2 disc version. It's impressive.
If you have an open mind and can take it for what it is, this will become a favorite, I guarentee it

I was very impressed with this story. I saw it in the theater, and also have this version on DVD.  This is one of the most intense, longest, fulfilling movies available on the topic of the pornography industry in the 70's and 80's.  Very stylistic and (un)believable.  A (c)ockumentary of superior proportions.  But it wasn't really a documentary, just a Hollywood movie, based on a time, when porn was coveted by the raincoat crowd.  

When I say (un)believable, I mean the story truely is unbelievable, in that the porn industry is not a man actor's world, but clearly belongs to the female actor.  She is the star in this industry.  So, when I see a movie like this, I worry for the young men out there, who think that they are the next "Dirk Diggler."  

While, I'm probably over worrying the concept, I still hope that my words reach some man out there.  This is not reality.  This is a fantasy, conceptualized by a Hollywood Director; and nothing more.

In reality, this could have easily been a story written about a female actress, such as Rollergirl?  Interesting enough, the director fell into the cliche, making Rollergirl, a victim.  Chastised by her Highschool classmates, and ran out of school.  But in reality, we in the know, know that it is the Jenna Jameson's and Tera Patrick's who are the real starts.  

I give this one 5 stars though, as it really is an over the top effort by the director.  I was quite impressed.

Two hard ones up!  This movie rocks!

Boogie Nights is one of those films, in the vein of Blow, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Requiem for a Dream, that stares unflinchingly at something ugly and asks us to follow along without blinking.  When it's the porn industry, it's hard not to blink.

It's the swinging 70s, and porn is on the rise.  Eddie Adams AKA Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg), is a fresh-faced lad with a particular gift.  That gift happens to be in his pants.  His reputation is well known, but it's only when porn director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) discovers him that Dirk's career takes off.  And thus begins a bizarre journey into the seedier side of filmmaking, complete with diva-level antics, arguments about video technology, and lots of sex and drugs.

What's alternately curious and interesting about the film is that this is a traditional rag to riches story, only it happens to involve porn.  Dirk is portrayed as having a natural talent, a trait every character observes with deadly seriousness.  His talent, and the dedication to his "art," elevates the entire porn industry itself, from merely badly filmed shaky-cam sex films to dramas with plot and character development.  Well, what passes for character development in porn, anyway.

There's Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), a porn queen barred from seeing her own children and subsequently mother to everybody. Reed Rothschild (John C. Reilly) is Dirk's right-hand man and frequent co-star.  Rollergirl (Heather Graham in her best acting role yet), does it with her roller skates on.  All the time.  Buck Swope (Don Cheadle) is a black porn star that wants to live the American dream of owning his own business.  And finally, we have Little Bill (William H. Macy), assistant director to Horner and married to a utterly hedonistic woman who does it with everyone, everywhere, at any time. 

By the time we get to the 80s, several characters are dead, video is king, and Dirk is too hopped up on drugs to notice that it's affecting his performance.  A falling out with Horner leads Dirk to strike out on his own, trying to be anything but a porn star.  Unfortunately, Dirk's only good at one thing. And it takes him most of the movie to figure out what that is.

Horner, Waves, and Dirk creates their own twisted, happy family.  Incapable of living in society separately due to the stigma of what they do, they form a kinship that only they can share.  And even they have their own bonds and boundaries; to their work, to themselves, to each other.  Those that cannot define who they are end up dead or in prison, or worse.  

In the end, Boogie Nights is about making good with what you've got.  And yes that means even porn stars sometimes have to face facts: sometimes you're best talent is having sex on camera. The question becomes what a 17-year-old kid turned porn star is supposed to do about it.  Boogie Nights answers it in the final scene, when the true star of the film is unzipped to stare us in the face

Upon my viewing of Zoo TV: Live in Sydney" at the tender age of ten, it is secure to articulate that I was most enamored with U2.  Now being twenty-one years of age, this particular show still draws me.  Despite having been previously stated before in aforementioned reviews, U2 are unquestionably at their best.  That is not to declare that U2 attained their peak during the Zoo TV Tour, quite the contrary, for their tours succeeding have been and are just as extraordinary.  After it was announced that Zoo TV should finally be released onto DVD, a U2 fan such as I could not facilitate but express delight and make purchase with all haste.  I highly recommend this product.

This title was actually one of the first DVDs announced for the DVD format back in 1997.  If you can find an old copy of "Four Weddings and a Funeral" or other PolyGram DVDs of that era in their unique "slide-down" polycarbonate cases, you can see a brief preview of what this DVD was supposed to be. Unfortunately, PolyGram cancelled it shortly before it was supposed to be released, and it has been the Holy Grail of U2 fans for the past 9 years. Until it came out, the best format this was available on was CLV laserdisc, with none of the bonus stuff

The 90's Quadrilogy of Achtung Baby,Zooropa,The Passengers(released under that psuedonym)and Pop are the last daring albums of U2's career. This concert footage parodies not only U2's celebrity, but celebrity in general. With banks and banks of television moniters decorating the stage, the band was mocking it's own ubiquity. Sadly, they have now become everything they were making fun of on this tour

Well, finally we've reached the end of the "yellow brick road" and have ourselves a great DVD release with this AWESOME concert out of Oz, Nov 1993.  

I love how this band still gives the fans what they want (check that:  NEED lol)  and release great great great DVD's of their live shows!  I mean, I am a Prince fan also (not as much as I was was I was 14)and that guy has BARELY let out any of his spectacular concert shows!("Syracuse '85", "Sign O' the Times", "Rave 2000", and now "Alladin Live"---that's it??)  out on VHS or DVD.  "Alladin" &amp; "Rave" were the ONLY DVD releases, well officially anyways.

U2 could and would put out a LIVE anthology boxed set - 1979-2006 if they wanted to and it would not have to be culled from any of their already released live DVD/VHS releases(ie "Zoomerang Sydney", "POPMART Mexico City" etc)I mean the MIND BOGGLES at the possibilities!  But what has come out has been quality AND quantity!  I mean they put out the fabulous "Chicago 2005" show last year (SAME year it was recorded -in MAY!) and there is talk of ANOTHER "Vertigo Tour" DVD (forgot what show -I wanna say another Mexico City) this year too!  I mean we U2 fans have it too damn good!  

I know a forthcoming "Popmart" DVD release is due probably next year. And like this DVD they will put out a great transfer with fun bonus material and really capture the "era" it represented.  "ZOO TV" and "POPMART" are both my two favorite tours, even though I never got myself to a U2 concert until November 2001 and THAT was a transcendent experience!  Same with "Vertigo in Nov 2005", but that show was not to the high standard left by the big stadium tours.

These guys still deliver.  Wait and be patient for "Red Rocks 1983" too it will come out soon I think!  And when it does, expect the same love and care given out by the men from U2!!!

Incredible ! Zoo TV , 12 years on and still holding up strong...IMHO Achtung Baby / Zoo TV was as revolutionary, groundbreaking and mezmerizing to 90s Rock as The Beatle's Sgt. Pepper was in the 60's. 
Get this DVD.

Live from Sydney is the first DVD release to actually take place long before the others. Done around the Achtung Baby/Zooropa era, the DVD is missing a lot of those songs from Pop to All That You Can't Leave Behind and Atomic Bomb. For some it's great (I mean, how often can we see Beautiful Day and Elevation on a DVD?) while others wish that certain songs were included or that the concert took place after a certain record. Zoo TV was just the precursor to the band's too-ambitious PopMart tour yet at the same time it's great to see that spectacle aspect.

As usual with a U2 DVD, the set tends to be chockful of whatever album they were promoting. Not that Achtung Baby is a bad album, in fact it's my top U2 album trumping the usual de-facto best album Joshua Tree. Only thing is though is that the set seems to be one Achtung Baby track after another. Great to see Even Better than the Real Thing while I wish Wild Horses was on. However, we get some great moments including a great Unchained Melody rendition, Lemon on DVD finally as well as Love is Blindness. One disappointment is that there's no All I Want is You, Heartland, I Still Haven't Found..., Bad, and damnit, put Gloria for a change on the set.

Of course anyone can go through an entire U2 DVD and whine about what they missed or what they haven't written yet such as Discotheque and Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me. Where the show does shine though is there's a true grandiose fashion to it all. From car floodlights to a big remote control checking out soccer games to Bono calling for a cab, it's a far cry from the relatively straightforward DVD's of recent. While it is missing a bit of those charismatic moments such as the Boston DVD where he lay beside a girl on the stage or Slane Castle where he was practically in tears during Kite but during Love is Blindness he actually held onto a fan for almost the entire song...in Macphisto makeup.

While it doesn't have the power of Boston or intimacy of Slane Castle, it's nonetheless a great portrait of rockers who were very daring and showmen at one point

FIRST OFF:

"The Man in the Moon", is a great film! With Robert Mulligan, the director of 'To Kill A Mockingbird' and 'The Summer of 42' at the helm, and a 14 year old Reese Witherspoon as Dani, who shines in the role of a coming of age teenage girl in love for the first time, the film certainly starts out on the right foot.

IN A NUTSHELL: A TALE OF 2 SISTERS [some plot spoilers below]

Its roughly the summer of 1957 in rural Louisiana. Maureen Trant, 17, [Emily Warfield] and Dani Trant, 14, [Reese Witherspoon] are sisters. Very close bonds hold them together, but this summer will put a strain on their relationship. The strain comes in the form of Mr. Right appearing without warning as the boy next store. His name is Court Foster [Jason London] and he is 17 years old. 

The trouble is, Dani saw him first, or more correctly he saw her. The family knows that Dani has an older friend next store who happens to a boy, but owing to the age differences and the boy's character nobody is worried -- except Court. He's got a little girl following him around and he has to admit it too himself that he wants her around -- and perhaps more -- too much more?! 

THEN THE PLOT THICKENS: [more plot spoilers below]

Maureen never sees Court until we're about halfway through the summer, since she was out on a date when his family returned to the farm and they had dinner at the Trants. When she does see him, he has come to their house to visit Dani, but then something happens.

Court and Maureen are obviously taken with each other and Dani can't believe it. How could her sister betray her like this? From this point on the movie is about the strain between the two sisters when Mr. Right appears to both of them as the perfect man.

Robert Mulligan - Director

Sam Waterston  - Matthew Trant 
Tess Harper  - Abigail Trant 
Gail Strickland  - Marie Foster 
Reese Witherspoon  - Dani Trant 
Jason London  - Court Foster 
Emily Warfield  - Maureen Trant 
Bentley Mitchum  - Billy Saunders 

ABOUT THE DVD: EXCELLENT WIDESCREEN TRANSFER

SPECIAL FEATURES: THEATRICAL TRAILER &amp; SCENE SELECTIONS - WISH THERE WERE MORE


BOTTOM LINE: THIS IS A 'REEL' SLICE OF LIFE THAT WON'T DISAPPOINT

This is quite a little story with a big punch. The supporting roles are impeccably played with Sam Waterston playing Matthew Trant, the father, and Tess Harper playing Abigail Trant, as the mother. They have their own personal dramatic subplot in this summer of 57 in Louisiana.

I loved the setting of this movie; it was out in the country with peaceful nature sounds I enjoy hearing. The pace was relaxed but not dull at all. The plot was sweet, the acting well done. Reese Witherspoon demonstrated her talent in this movie, her first major role.

I saw this movie as a teenager and immediately identified with Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Dani Trant, a 14-year-old tomboy in rural Louisiana circa 1957. She feels that she will never be as beautiful as her older sister, Maureen (a now rarely seen Emily Warfield), and feeling out of place in terms of her conservative Baptist upbringing. Then seventeen year old Court Foster (Jason London), the son of her mother's close friend (Gail Strickland) moves in next door, Dani experiences her first crush, while Court enjoys her company, and willful spirit. Dani succeeds in getting her first kiss from him, but as soon as he sees Maureen, he falls head over heels for her, leaving Dani behind. The sisters' close bond is fractured severely by the rivalry that erupts, which only deepens when Court dies in a tragic accident. The girls then are made to realize how much they need each other.

Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are just perfect as the loving parents, trying to balance their daughters' individuality, at the same time trying to keep the family together. The beautiful cinematography, and the wonderful soundtrack featuring Elvis Presley, The Platters and many more contribute wonderfully to the film's atmosphere of a simpler time.

A touching coming-of-age film with a timeless message

This is a masterpiece of cinema. After watching Robert Mulligan's more famous (to me) movies: To Kill a Mockingbird and Summer of '42, I found this jewel. I did not think that the same man could create a third work of art but here it is.

Directors like Ford, Hawks, Lubitsch or Vidor and Capra are long gone, and so is cinema as art, but a few movies like this one seem to resurrect it, although it may only last a blink of an eye.

I am off to check out "Come September" now.

Who is this Robert Mulligan, anyway?

Lovable little gem

Excellent movie. Seriously, why can't they make more movies like this? Smart, well-acted, very dramatic, exciting. I could go on and on. Just a very satisfying movie....each of the thousand times I have watched it. If I accidently come across it on TNT or HBO or wherever, I have to sit and watch it until the end even though I have it on DVD right there on my bookshelf! I can't walk away!

I love the beginning of the movie when they are boarding the sub, and they are standing in the rain while Hackman addresses the crew, and he has that little Q&amp;A routine with the chief of the boat (George Dzundza). This scene really sets the tone. It almost made me want to join the Navy. 

The battle between Hackman and Washington's characters is, of course, what the movie is all about, and they pull it off flawlessly. Very good work by both men. That said, all of the key charactors are interesting and well-acted. The director really pulls this movie together very well despite the many charactors involved (many of these guys are big stars now). 

The great acting, the very exciting story, and edge of the seat drama just overwhelm whatever weaknesses or improbabilities that may exist in this movie. Great stuff.

This is a simply amazing movie, and what makes it even more stellar is that we've had several fantastic submarine movies in the past - Das Boot and Red October come to mind. We've already seen the claustrophobic, booming power of being trapped in an underwater submarine. That this movie is able to make that closeness even more powerful - and draw us into a story that really grips you with its meaning - is rather impressive. 

We begin with two powerhouses of actors, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington. Gene is in charge of the sub; Denzel works for him. Gene is an unabashed alpha male, not unheard of in a commander. Denzel is intelligent and respects the chain of command. Suddenly, we're thrown into a situation where the sub *might* have been ordered to launch a missile attack on an enemy to protect the US. Unfortunately, the sub can't get confirmation. So either they shoot and risk starting WWIII for no reason - or they fail to shoot and leave millions of people open to slaughter. 

The plot and dialogue is incredible because it explores all the shades of grey in the characters. There's no right or wrong. Both scenarios are equally plausible. Gene wants to do what he was ordered to do, to save as many lives as he can. Denzel is desperate to get confirmation rather than risk mistakenly starting a world war. Both men suck up the men around them into their sides. Nobody WANTS the war. Gene doesn't take pleasure in firing - but he sees it as a necessary action to save lives. 

In such close confines, every person on screen makes a huge difference. This movie had not only two stellar top men, but also a fantastic supporting cast. James Gandolfini a la Sopranos. Viggo Mortensen a la Lord of the Rings. The music from Hans Zimmer is just amazing. He is a genius and can give incredibly subtle nuances to his works. 

If I had to find something to nit-pick in this movie, it's that I don't think the sub scenes were truly "realistic". It seemed more of a Hollywood sub than a real working piece of machinery that trained soldiers were living in for months. I think Das Boot did an exquisite job of getting that sense across. But really, the sub in this case was a "set" for the dialogue and character development to happen in. It wasn't the showcase, and this wasn't a sub documentary. So I'm willing to accept that tradeoff, so that we could have as tightly woven a story as we got.

The very best war movies resonate with viewers not just because of top flight acting but because there is always a subtext present that demands that viewers think as well as view.  In CRIMSON TIDE, director Tony Scott allows the events on the USS Alabama, a nuclear submarine, to force viewers to confront some truly ugly but inevitable revelations: that in some dicey situations there are no good versus bad guys, just decent men who demand that events follow their own unique perceptions of those events. 

Gene Hackman is Captain Ramsey, a tough nuclear sub skipper who has just received an order to launch his sub's missles at Russia, which has just discovered that one of its military bases has been taken over by a rogue general who is determined to launch his missles at America.  Just after Ramsey receives his order to launch, the needed verfication to launch does not arrive due to an unexpected underwater confrontation with a Russian sub.  The Alabama's radio is damaged. Should Ramsey launch anyway on the premise that to delay can lead only to the certainty that the Russians will get the first blow in? His XO, Lieutenant Commander Turner (Denzel Washington) does not think so.  Both believe that the other is totally wrong.  Turner leads a mutiny to prevent the launch.

CRIMSON TIDE is a claustrophobic testosterone filled plunge into the icy waters of duty versus rationality.  Hackman injects his role with the total believability of ruthlessness that has come to mark his essential film persona.  He can slug Washington in the face in one scene to enforce his decision to launch.  Then in the very next scene can placidly discuss horse breeding with the same man with the same believability. CRIMSON TIDE is a film of men under stress with some handling it better than others.  George Dzundza has a powerful supporting role as the head of security who is forced by circumstances to back Washington, whom he believes to be in the right over Ramsey, a captain whom he greatly respects but believes to be in the wrong.  When Ramsey regains control, Dzundza grudgingly admits, "Half of me is glad that he did."  And that right there is the compelling subtext of the movie: that events force both actor and viewer to decide whether unfolding events ought to fill us with fear that one or the other side may be in the Right--but never knowing which is which.  CRIMSON TIDE is a terrific film that requires the viewer to face such a choice whether he wants to or not

 This movie was good, though there were many innacuracies as to what really goes on inside a nuclear sub. That aside it is very good

I GIVE THE DVD A 1 STAR NOT THE MOVIE. JUST TO LET YOU GUYS KNOW ABOUT A NEW DISC SET COMING OUT. Finally this morning, Disney has delayed the DVD release of the Crimson Tide: Unrated &amp; Extended Edition from 3/14 to 5/16. No word as to why

When this movie came out in 1995, I caught it in the theatre and enjoyed it so much, I bought the Video Tape (and just to let you know - The Hunt for Red October, Video Tape, also!).  But I digress.  Gang, it appears that a "Unrated" version of "Crimson Tide" is coming out on DVD.  "Unrated??"  What could they possible put on the DVD to make it unrated?  The scheduled release date is 03/14/2006.  IF I can equate "Unrated Version = Special Edition,"  then I'm in for my copy!  Great movie - Four Stars!!

  I watched the film in the theater when it came out, was very disappointed in all the inaccuracies. Trying to "entertain"/ educate people on a subject matter so serious with a plot so ludicrous is irresponsible at best. The Pet Dog was cute but also unrealistic. The book "The Gold Crew" had a more believable plot.

  Having served on a few Ballistic Missile Submarines, I find it an insult to the Crews of the Boats Especially to the Captains and officers.

 It's Understandable why the Navy Refused to Bless this. By placing there seal of approval on this film they would be saying it could happen, which it couldn't as depicted. Too much control and too many people in the loop to allow it.

 From November 15, 1960-May 25, 2001. The Navy completed 3500 Deterrent Patrols which roughly equates to 671 years of combined ship service on alert ready to launch. And there Still out there boring holes in the water

Take a solid script about nuclear warfare, puff it up with Quentin Tarantino style, cram it all into a submarine called the U.S.S. Alabama, throw in the legendary Gene Hackman and future legend Denzel Washington and what do you get?  "Crimson Tide."

One of the best military flicks I've ever seen.  Chock full of emotion, intensity and suspense, "Crimson Tide" takes the viewer on a whirlwind tour of life, death, and warfare on a nuclear Naval submarine.  Hackman is the captain of the Alabama, a sub destined to launch nuclear missiles on Russia in a last ditch attempt to suppress rebel forces in that country.  Denzel Washington is the handpicked XO that is forced to make a terrible decision.  During an undersea battle with rebel forces, an emergency message is lost during transmission.  Was the message sent to stop plans to fire the nuclear missiles or to go ahead with the plans?  Hackman insists he go ahead with his original orders to launch the nukes.  Washington stands against him and has the captain sent to his quarters.  All of this is done by the book.  What results is a mutiny by the captain in an attempt to regain control of his sub and continue his original mission.

Full of intense sequences involving life and death situations, this film left me exhausted by the constant decisions made and the timing of each event.  Hackman and Washington were superb in their roles.  Each conveyed the emotion and allegiance of their respective characters flawlessly.  

But the list of excellent actors doesn't stop there.  Viggo Mortensen, of "Lord of the Rings" and "Hidalgo" fame, plays Webster.  He's Washington's friend and a loyal officer on the ship who literally holds the fate of the world in his hands.  Steve Zahn ("Saving Silverman," "Daddy Daycare," "Happy, Texas") is solid in a supporting role.  Former child star Rick Schroder also appears in a brief but moving role.  Danny Nucci ("Titanic") plays an officer who stands for what he believes is right.  James Gandolfini ("The Sopranos") is also here in a wonderfully sinister role as Hackman's loyal shipmate.  Oh, and don't forget to throw in Ryan Phillipe ("I Know What You Did Last Summer," "Cruel Intentions"), who has a miniscule role but does well none the less.  There are other faces in the crowd who haven't achieved as much fame, but you'll recognize them from smaller roles in other films.  For instance, George Dzundza, who's been in a ton of films but never a star and Scott Grimes, who I only knew was in this film when I saw the credits role.  You may recognize Grimes' name from "Critters."  In short, this motion picture has a very capable cast of well-known performers, future stars, and minor players who fill out the plot exceptionally well.

Highly recommended to fans of claustrophobic cinema such as "The Hunt For Red October" and naval stories in general.  Also, fans of intense drama will definitely enjoy this film

Three jocular guys get on stage and do a lampoon homage to the classics, while breaking down the fourth wall like a wrecking ball. The Beastie Boys? Nope, it's the Reduced Shakespeare Company. They break character, break the play, argue about the direction of the play (like kids in a pick-up game), toss good-natured insults, and interact with/razz the audience.  They even do a long spoof on pretentious acting workshops, as they prepare a dragged up audience member to say her line (actually, she just has to scream -- but it's a good one with subtext! :-)  Throughout the show, the trio's "what next" anarchy is more entertaining than their condensed versions of plays. 

For Bard vets, this disc may re-contextualize your ideas about the plays. For kids and beginners, it may inspire. (It's obvious that the Reduced players mastered Shakespeare before they broke it down). For people who read prescribed Shakespeare as a chore, with MTV on... and never looked back (like me)... the show's anarchy/"lack of respect" will entertain. In short, the Reduced posse has something for everyone.  It may even be better than reading Macbeth Cliffs notes with the Beastie Boys cranked up to 11.... Maybe....  "If you, wanna know, the real deal about the three, well let me tell you we're triple trouble, y'all, we're gonna bring you up to speed -- check it out!" (Beastie Boys).  Get your learn on

There are a few moments in the play that thankfully my younger children didn't seem to get, but I wouldn't have missed their acting it out afterwards for all the money in the world!

One reviewer wrote that it helps to have a knowledge of Shakespeare before watching, and I agree to an extent. That does make it funnier when they combine the titles of the comedies,  however I also feel that someone unfamiliar will want to become familiar after watching this group play with the material so easily. 

Fantastic and refreshing!

And yes, while it is helpful to know your Shakespeare (*ahem* Team Francis Bacon), it is not necessary to have more than a passing recollection of the tediousness of it that was foisted off onto you in high school, to find this comedy troupe a laugh riot. With all the $100 million+ budget drivel coming out of Hollywood in the last decade, it was really nice just to be able to sit back and enjoy something chock full of talent and mirth.

These guys are terrific! I'm a student of Shakespeare, so every time I read a play I haven't read before I pull out this DVD to see what they've done to it! After reading Coriolanus I was rolling on the floor with their comments on how this play wasn't appropriate for children. If you love Shakespeare, or are just curious about Shakespeare, buy this DVD

This movie is still as good today as it has always been. I had the original on VHS, but decided to get the DVD because I don't have a video machine any more. The only problem I have is that I was hoping for subtitles because the accent is a bit thick in places and I can't make out what they are saying. I checked the spec and Amazon says the DVD had subtitles. But when I played the movie it said there was were no subtitles. Besides that, no other issues with the DVD.

Scott Neal and Glen Berry team up in this British film of two gay adolesents coming to terms with their sexuality and the pitfalls it entails. I don't know of a more tender, sweet love story between two young males than "BEAUTIFUL THING". The title says it all. In the face of a cruel world, predjudice society, and family struggles, these two lads find something beautiful and unique, through each other, that they never knew could possibly exist. This is the perfect companion video to "GET REAL". Very tastefully done with superb acting talent and a good supporting cast. If you like gay romance, and coming of age films, this one will surely go down as one your very favorites of all time

I really felt like I had to give some real insight to the people who are wondering whether they should watch this or not.You people writing the reviews are being waaay to generous to this movie.With how slow the movie started off you would think that the relationship between the two main characters would slowly and steadily build up-from a close friendship to a romantic relationship.

The guys don't even display a close friendship at the beginning, how are they gonna jump from "a guy you see during soccer practice and around your building" to "hot and heavy can't live without each other love"?It's not believable, and doesn't make for a good coming of age love story that this movie tries to be.The movie just hits you with an abrupt and sudden love scene, and from there they are suddenly in love and everything.In fact,there is no indication that either character is gay until that scene.I mean it would have been nice if the movie showed that one guy was into his neighbor or checked him out from time to time, or even was interested in guys in general but as I said before the movie doesn't display any type of interest the guys may have in each other or just guys in general until the love scene.

Don't get me wrong,I enjoyed the movie but the reviewers here aren't really giving an accurate representation of the movie and are HIGHLY overrating it.So if your in the mood for an ok gay teen movie by all means grab some popcorn sit back and enjoy.If you're looking for a masterpiece of cinema involving a gay relationship.Look somewhere else.This is not the movie

I did enjoy this film - it had animated characters - gay sexual tensions - a bit of drama - and a heartwarming ending
 - 4 stars - 

You know the story Gay Boy (Jamie) falls for the Hot Boy Next Door (Ste). Is he Gay? Is he Straight? Find out in this loving film about your average nutty neighbors all trying to coexist. Plus this film features a scene that had me holding my breath - Jamie makes the first move, a very tense moment in any young mans life!

Movies, plays, and books are all subjective endeavors. The idea is to suspend your disbelief while reading or watching the piece.  In the case of BEAUTIFUL THING, that is not hard  to do.  

From the opening frame you want Jamey to thrive. He hates PE because the macho guys pick on him as they start a game of soccer (the English call it football). He jumps the fence and heads home skipping PE for the umpteenth time. Who can blame him and when a school chum's, Ste's, homelife with his brother and father takes an abusive turn, Jamey's mother rescues him on those nights and the two teens form a bond that goes well beyond friendship.

As the two guys struggle to deal with their love and erotic feelings for each other, the music of Mama Cass Elliott plays in the background. The story and the music is an enchanting combination that intensifies your urge to see them make it as a couple.  You know they are young but not too young.  You wish that had happened to you when you were their age.

Earlier reviews have already mentioned the terrific supporting cast as well as the two leads in this story, so I won't go into that here.  Instead, I want you to see the DVD so you can experience the feeling I felt at the end of the movie when Jamey and Ste begin a slow dance in the street in full view of their neighbors.  Unlike a few of my friends who dismissed this scene as unrealistic in a poor working class neighborhood, I chose to suspend my disbelief and each time I watch it, I mouth the word "yes".

I find this film very interesting, though not for the reasons you would expect. It's about two male teenagers living in a working class neighborhood in London, who one day discover they are attracted to each other. One of them is not even aware that he might be gay (Ste, the popular athlete). Put in this way, it may sound like your typical coming of age gay story. But it is much more than that. And what makes this movie really special is the supporting cast. They carry the weight of the story. The character played by Linda Henry (Sandra, Jamie's mother) is truly fascinating, and her performance is astounding. And Leah  deserves a film just for herself. Also the soundtrack by Mama Cas and the Mamas &amp; Papas is a standout. I think that both gay and straight audiences will enjoy this excellent film

Fortunitely, way back when, I got a hold of a vinyl album that spotlighted various tracks of comedic highlights from this show. Fortunitely this show plays on cable like "I Love Lucy". The opening duet and final piano play were both included on the vinyl album in entirety. 
The show had many moments that could make the most solemn creature belt a good one because the situations were anything but goody-goody. They were newsworthy from pregnancy, abortion, homosexuality, atheism, religion, politics, and of course, bigotry. I read one article, back when the show first premiered, that a woman called her son long distance to make him tune in to "All In The Family" so he could see how his deceased father was.

It's amazing to watch this television series and realize we live in an age where people seem to believe everything goes (like same sex marriages, freedom of just about everything including behavior) yet many of the topics addressed with humor in this show are completely taboo on the regular channels. It was funny during the 70's, and it's still funny today

This T.V show rates as one of my favorites of all time. In the genre of comedy it is my favorite show to date. One of the great things about All In The Family was its ability to take the viewer on a slice of life journey through the comedic irony and sometimes painful reality of life. In my humble opinion Carroll O'Conner and Jean Stapleton were and are two of the greatest acting talents ever. This DVD collection is very well done. I highly recommend it to all.

Archie Bunker is the funniest sitcom character in television history. I own all five seasons and am eagerly awaiting the sixth. Of course, like most sitcoms, the humor of the first season does not have quite as much punch as the rest of them. But, I DID about split my side on the very last episode of this season, especially where Archie says...(see review title)

As usual, Archie has his crazy ideas of how the world works, the races work, women work, and everything else that he's made up or gathered from his brain or bigoted friends.  I love every minute of it!  I think I enjoy this show because if you look past the obvious, you will learn a lesson.  Episodes like "Judging Books By Covers" explains that it's not always the most obvious that are homosexual...and just like anybody else, they are people too, so get over it.  In "Lionel Moves Into the Neighborhood," it is more than obvious that Lionel has been coming into Archie's home for years, but suddenly when a black family moves into the neighborhood, Archie realizes that he may have to bend more of his "rules".  I am crazy about Lionel's tactics in dealing with Archie...and how Archie can't seem to realize that Lionel is making fun of him ALL THE TIME. "The First and Last Supper" was entertaining because this is when George Jefferson gets to show that he is just as bad as Archie by not showing up to dinner.  
This was a brave show to put on television, not because it showed a racist view. We have plenty of those type of shows today.  But because "All in the Family" makes fun of prejudice, racism, and sexism in a way that no show has done since.

'Amazon reviewers' have already pointed out the dramatic change this show brought to sit- com TV. They have also indicated the specific episodes included here. They have said something about Archie and dingbat Edith, Meatball and little sweet Gloria. My only addition is to point out how much pleasure this show brought to my own parents, of blessed memory.

Perhaps one of the best book adaptations ever done.  Mr. Maxwell's work to keep the complexity of the issues in tact in order to tell the whole story is commendable.   Mr. Shaara's novel provided a great resource and Mr. Maxwell gave the visual display its magic.   The depth of the characters could be equallied only by the real characters themselves.   Mr. Duvall gave a performance expected of his talents.  Mr. Lang provided the quintessential "Stonewall" in all his intense humanity and passion in faith.   For the lover of history, the detail is exceptional.   It may drag too long for those wanting pure entertainment but for those wishing to immerse themselves in the time, this is the film where you can.   Admirers of "Stonewall" will especially appreciate this film.  Those unfamiliar with "Stonewall" will see why his character looms so large in our history as the ideal example of a man.   His intensity still shines forth more than a century later.   It is a melancholy movie that helps us live the horror of those days and recognize the complexity of war where there is no one who is clearly right or wrong in the end.  

In addition, the special features including the interviews and the haunting music videos are superb.   I had the opportunity to preview this movie before its initial release in theatres and I am very pleased with the result that has survived in this DVD edition.   It was best on the big screen for the sense of scale and epic feel but let your imagination go back and come ride with Stonewall.

An almost endearing stiltedness undergirds this fine film's narrative, as though set pieces have been prepared in order to allow the characters to deliver solemn speeches Though this may appear artificial and even insincere to modern movie-viewers, it is a dramatic technique at least as old as Homer's ILIAD and ODYSSEY. What GODS AND GENERALS shares with those ancient poetic balads is the celebration of the fighting man's nobility, his rage, and the juxtaposition of profoundly ordinary human sentiment alongside the most inhumane deeds one can imagine.

GODS AND GENERALS sustains a tone of deep sadness throughout, the director's way of highlighting the tragedy of a war fought among brothers. This nation's founding fathers achieved their political miracle at the cost of leaving the issue of slavery unresolved. It was bound to raise its head in a union-threatening manner eventually. The events of 1861-1865 were the bursting of a wound that had festered as long as it could.

True, Lincoln took the nation to war over the matter of the union's preservation, but it was slavery and vastly different social visions that placed the union in danger in the first place. 

The film follows the trajectory of General Lee and - more prominently - Virginia's 'Stonewall' Jackson. The latter preferred that the eponym be used only of the brigade he led, not of himself.  But his grateful men would have it no other way. 'Stonewall Jackson' he would be from Manassas on, and 'Stonewall' he would die.

Robert Duvall, Stephen Lang, and Jeff Daniels do their characters proud, though it is perhaps Duvall's General Lee who most rings true to the man's decency, calm, and painful array of allegiances.

Mira Sorvino briefly lights up the screen as the Maine Lieutenant Coronel Chamberlain's wife, Mrs. Fanny Chamberlain.

'War', one of the characters is early heard to say, 'is the sum of all evils' and its reputed provocation by Mr. Lincoln 'a most dreadful mistake'.

The achievement of GODS AND GENERALS is to show that the waging of war sometimes falls to the most decent of men, who at times find fratricide thrust upon them, carrying the dreadfulness of their predicament to their graves.

This film should be seen by all who care about the formation of the American republic, a city upon a hill that has nonethess found bloody water lapping upon its gates, staining its streets, and drowning numbers of its finest

It is hard to believe that the same team that made Gettysburg made this verbose waste of time.  This movie almost guarantees that The Last Full Measure will never be filmed and that is a shame.

It was a mistake to take Stephen Lang and put him in the role of Jackson.  Jackson was considered, even by his contemporaries, a military genius but crazy by half.  The film missed the mark with their attempt to show his religious convictions and his devotion to duty.  Lang had him speaking in long winded prose that sounded like bad soap opera dialog desperately trying to be Shakespearean.  The prayer scene in the morning? PUKE!  It could have been a voice over with battles scenes or soldiers marching, or anything else rather than what became just a terrible scene.

Most of the "women" folk of the south were equally sappy and long winded, and I hate to say it but I was glad when the too precocious for words overacting child died of scarlet fever I was glad to be rid of her.  Her scenes should have been left on the cutting room floor.  I get it Jackson was "such a warrior and a peaceful lover of children at the same time what a diametrically opposed individual" give me a break, I hate being force feed like that.  A better Director could have gotten the same point across quicker and more subtly.  

Then there is Chamberlain quoting Shakespeare while all around him look off to the distance with thousand yard stares.  

There is supposedly 4 to 6 hours of footage lying around to this film.  I would love to see it reworked by a better director into what it should have been.  A narrative like Gettysburg that goes back and forth between a few central characters in a logical sequence without all the ham fisted attempts a proselytizing and all the noblesse oblige.

If you must see it borrow it, rent it, but don't waste money buying it unless it is in the $3 bin at the local dirtmart.

Gettysburg is much better.  I actually missed Sheen and I hate that guy

I'm not a Civil War expert, but having recently visited Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg, I paid very close attention to the history told me by the guides as well as the books I read. When I came home I watched both Gettysburg and Gods and Generals again, and I must say, the events of these important battles come to life in these DVDs. Yes, there's always going to be some interpretation done, but overall I thought the acting was well done and the information reliable. The characters were well developed, as I felt that I got a chance to really know what these men were like. If you want to see history, then I would recommend this and Gettysburg as well

REO still rocks and this concert proves that Rock and Roll is still alive with this power performance!  The band still has the youthful hunger of the early years!  Lead Kevin Cronin's voice still sounds great singing favorites like:"Time for me to fly," "Don't let him go," "Take it on the run," "Keep on loving you," "Can't fight this feeling anymore," "and so many others!! I love the lead guitar in REO Dave Amato!! Awesome lead guitar gives REO a great edge! I've seen REO this summer in concert recently and saw how the audience, including me, just gravitated to the front of the stage and rocked the night away!  We all knew the songs and the place became a communal atmosphere that just doesn't happen anymore with music. Luckily I happened to reach up and catch one of Kevin Cronin's guitar picks which now has a framed presentation in my bedroom. It was fun!  REO has brought back a better time for music and with this concert dvd, I can relive it over and over.  Don't forget the special features which are interviews with Kevin Cronin and Neal Doughty. Love it and you will too

&amp;quot;Plus&amp;quot; was brilliantly shot before an packed enthusiastic crowd in Kansas City, and shows the 5 guys of the current REO and how awesome performance musicians they are. Contains the same show on the Arch Allies CD with Styx, but this is REO on their own and That Ain't Love, Keep Pushin, and Tough Guys were added. They can't stop rockin, in fact they sound tighter live than many bands sound in the studio. It also contains interviews with Kevin and Neal (on the DVD they are separate from the performance), and the DVD also contains 5.1 Dolby sound, and a trivia game fun and challenging for even longtime fans. Highly recommended whether or not you've worn out your copy of the Wheels are Tourin video :-

A great film with an engrossing story- I literally could not take my eyes off it.George Peppard's signature role (better than Tiffany's). If you long for a movie with a great story buy it! Congrats to Paramount for the excellent transfer- sharp with great colours and very little evidence of print damage

I'm a huge fan of the harold robbins novel but i've got to say that the film is every bit as good and probably better. The only thing lacking id the back story about nevada smith but he has his own film as well so i recommend getting that one also. overall its a terrific story and in a day and age when its all about special effects this film stands alone as a story, and a bloody good one at that

"The Carpetbaggers" is a fantastic adaptation of Harold Robbins' bestseller, very racy for its era, with dialogue that is often rare and juicy, a superb cast, and great direction by Edward Dmyrtryk. The character of Jonas Cord is loosely based on the life of Howard Hughes, and it is interesting to compare this film with Martin Scorsese's "The Aviator." Both George Peppard as Cord and Leonardo DiCaprio as Hughes give brilliant performances, but overall, I find this film far more satisfying, and certainly a lot more entertaining. 

Peppard was at the height of his career in this film, and it is perhaps his best. It gives him a wide range of emotions, as well as the physicality and toughness he was so good at. Others that shine in the large cast are Alan Ladd in what was to be his last film as Nevada Smith, Carroll Baker as the sultry Rina, Robert Cummings as Nevada's slick and slimey manager. Elizabeth Ashely as Mrs. Jonas Cord (and who soon after this film was to become the real life Mrs. Peppard), Martin Balsam as the owner of a film studio, and Lew Ayres, as second in command in Jonas Cord's empire, has some of the best lines in the film.

The pacing of the film never lags, and there is a brutal fight between Jonas and Nevada, one of those screen fights that is always fascinating to watch. The Nevada Smith character is quite complex, and was to spawn a "prequel" 2 years later, starring Steve McQueen. The cinematography by Joseph MacDonald is marvelous, the Edith Head gowns lavishly glamorous, and very important to the success of this film is the fabulous jazzy score, which is one of Elmer Bernstein's finest. In my youth I devoured all of Robbins' books, loved the well-written sleaze of them, and loved this film in its theatrical release. I've since watched it repeatedly, and find more to enjoy in it with each viewing. Total running time is 150 minutes.

I just got through watching this Dmytryk film on TCM tonight, and all I can say is that if you are looking for the George Peppard who played Paul Varjak in Breakfast at Tiffany's, forget it.  In fact, he is so cold and so stiff (I realize he's trying to play a nasty Howard Hughes knockoff), that a cardboard figurine would have been just as convincing in his stead.

Outside of great costumes and sets, this movie is long and boring.  Where it's not boring it's a snicker inducing raunchfest.  Poor Alan Ladd in his final role, barely having to act as he plays a drunken hasbeen, and Elizabeth Ashley who is the only redeeming character in the entire plot and also resembles Audrey Hepburn to a scary degree in the last half of this debacle.  Carroll Baker may be sexy in her lingerie, but she's so over-the-top with her heavy breathing and her lingerie that you actually want to cheer when her car goes off the road.

I can think of better ways to pass my time for 2 and 1/2 hours than this...like watching the mating rituals of moth-eaten underwear.  Still, you just can't stop watching it through to its unrealistic ending.  If I'd have thought beating up one of my old flames after years of his acting like a total jag would have changed him overnight, I'd have done it long ago!  If you must see this lousy piece of 60's smut, make sure you rent it or come across it on TV before you go buying it.  I've seen corpses that are more convincing than Peppard was in this flick!

This overwrought tripe is the cinematic equivalent to a dead fish.  It doesn't work as good trash or as high camp.  Edward Dmytryk directs Harold Robbins' source material with a lead foot.  George Peppard made a larger artistic contribution when he was on "The A-Team".  Alan Ladd, who had the misfortune to have this as his last film credit, essentially sleepwalks through this picture.  It's equally unfortunate that talented actors like Carroll Baker, Elizabeth Ashley, and Martin Balsam are associated with this swill.  Heck, I even feel bad for former boxing champ Archie Moore in his having to play the thankless role of houseboy.  The film's lone redeeming quality are the costume designs by Edith Head(the women's lingeree in particular).  If you must waste 150 minutes of your time it's better spent watching paint dry or grass grow

I just finished watching the &amp;quot;The Carpetbaggers&amp;quot; on AMC; I thought the 'C' part of that acronym was &amp;quot;Classic&amp;quot;, but now realize that perhaps 'Cornball,' 'Contagious,' or 'Compelling' may substitute since this movie seemed to be all of this.  But, hey, maybe that's just the gin talkin.  It is one of those movies that you cannot wait to end, so you can find out just who these B-film actresses really were - yet you continue to watch.  But when it does end, you are somewhat saddened that it is over.  Partially sad because you have been drawn in by this charismatic yet utterly ruthless SOB Jason Cord (George Peppard), but mostly just sad because AMC DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE CREDITS! that's why I'm here...finding out that the actresses were Caroll baker (as Rina Marlowe, the not-so-lovable Hollywood star; and Elizabeth Ashley (as Monica Cord) - the impossibly forgiving ex/not-so-happily-ever-after-wife of the unmarriable-unlovable-unrelenting-insanely ambitious Jason.  Bob Cummings gets accolades as the fiendishly charming scumbag who plays Dan Pierce - most probably a very typical Hollywood agent.  Someone who would put a rattlesnake in your pocket and then ask you for a match if he could get 10% of your blood in doing so.  Go ahead and watch the dern thing (4/5 stars) - You'll understand.  But hey - don't forgit the gin

Photographer Jim Brandenburg takes you on his personal photographic journey that re-awakened his spirit and love of his craft after a burn out shooting for National Geographic magazine.  Enchanting music from Michael Monroe accompanies the beautiful scenery and images from the northwoods of Minnesota.  Jim reflects on some of his unique experiences while capturing some of the images on his journey.  A must for photographers or anyone interested in wildlife and nature.  Highly recommended.

...how dumb movies can get. Then again, maybe I was stupid to expect a spark of intelligence in this film. Just to give you fair warning, Matt (the main character) is the only mildly pleasant person in this entire film. Matt decides to get rid of sex for Lent because of a bad break-up. In his endeavor, he proves to be a rather bumbly but sweet guy who is sadly surrounded by horrid jerks who mess up his life. Most of the film involves Matt trying desperately to keep his vow of chastity and/or his horrid male friends trying to either get him to break it or checking up on him by running flashlights over his bed in an attempt to find semen; no joke! Not only are his friends hormone induced morons, but nosier than middle-school girls to boot! One of them even thought it would be funny to make his vow public, which led to a whole new series of taunting. Since this film is full of dumb-male stereotypes, I rather wish they had added the one that portrays guys as automatically violent when they're angry, because Matt's friends deserved to have their empty skulls bashed in (they irritated me a bit, can you tell?) However, as bad as most of the guys in this film are, the girls aren't any better. Apparently the filmmakers decided to fit bad stereotypes for both sexes in the story, because all the girls were soulless harpies who manipulated Matt and never got what they deserved. First, there's Nicole, the one who dumped Matt. When she hears of his vow, she decides she wants him back, refuses to take no for an answer, then rapes him (yes, rapes him) later in the film when he's handcuffed to a bed and asleep. Nice girl, isn't she? Matt's new love interest, Erica, is not much better. Throughout the film, she yells at him and throws tantrums like a five-year-old for no good reason. First, she gets mad because he didn't tell her the instant he met her about his vow for Lent. She pulled up all kinds of dishonesty bull and claimed that he had wronged her. Why, because he hadn't revealed his personal business to her the minute they met? They weren't even a couple yet! Rather than realizing that she's a guy's worst nightmare and running for the hills, he spends the whole film tripping over himself to please her. Her dumbest moment was later in the film when she didn't believe that his ex had taken advantage of him. You'd think the fact that he was handcuffed to a bed and struggling to get free would've tipped her off! Again, he's the one who apologizes; why not just put her on her broom and send her back where she came from? Normally I'm not this scathing in my reviews, but this film is the lowest of the low in intelligence and very high in crudeness. Not recommende

Surviving 40 Days and Nights without Sex

        In the film 40 Days and 40 Nights, no sex is Kryptonite to Josh Hartnett's character, Matt because he cannot go through a day without thinking of sex and it ruins his social life by not being able to talk to girls without having sex on his mind. He strongly wants to follow through with his promise to himself by staying pure for the entire 40 days and nights.

	This film is perfectly made for Josh Hartnett for being such a teenage heartthrob. It's a wonderful comedy full of hilarity and sexy jokes. There are all kinds of things to laugh at such as the bagel guy to the crazy roommate.  Many of the characters in the movie are funny and don't make Matt have such an easy time with the whole 40 days and 40 nights. It's not something that he is capable of doing and they all have faith that he will fail.
	
         Matt being a raging sexaholic is a very strong character who attempts to not have sex for lent. Meaning for an entire 40 days and 40 nights he has to sacrifice what he enjoys most. Each day matt tries to do something constructive that helps him no think about sex, such as model car building and doing laundry. In the work place, Matt's co-workers start a bet to see which day he will break. It later turned into an online betting all over the internet. Prior to all of this he's been on a sex binge because of his girlfriend left him to dry. It's been the only thing that he knows and helps cope with the pain he's suffering.  Matt starts to go through sex withdraw and everything he sees turns into some sexy act in his mind.

        He then meets a girl while doing this laundry one day. Easily there's an attraction but knowing that he cannot have contact with any female physically, he keeps to himself and doesn't say a word to her. As time goes on Matt starts to talk to her and makes a date with her. The date goes wonderful but instilled in his mind is that he can't have any sexual acts with this woman. She finds this weird and at her work place she came upon the website with the online bets. This made things very difficult for him and her. She starts to lose interest in him when he tells her the truth about what he can't do. This is the first time he's felt this way for a woman other than his ex-girlfriend. He truly falls for her and this time he didn't have to have sex. In his mind he wants to get her back so bad but he has that promise to himself that he feels is more important. Now the movie becomes the typical love story where boy meets girl, boy loses girl, then boy will get her back.

	In anybody's point of view 40 Days and nights is torture to a character like Matt. Since he's such a lady's man and is extremely sex dependent. Many people know that 40 days isn't that much but to him it feels like an eternity.

I bought the set and was very surprised to find that the episodes were much better than I remember them.  I have to admit that they do not compare with the early All in the Family episodes, but neither do the later All in the Family episodes.  But none the less, I am glad they are on DVD and am glad that I purchased them.  Does anyone know if the second season will be available soon

I own every "All In The Family" season box set out on the market and started collecting the "Archie Bunker's Place" season box sets.  Can someone please explain to me why we still get edited versions??? I thought the idea behind dvd is that we are supposed to get commercial free and unedited versions.  To my knowledge, even All in the Family has a few edited episodes.  Why are they doing this?  It is frustrating

"Archie Bunker's Place" was a wonderful sequel to the infamously wonderful sitcom 'All in the Family'. Winnipeg Manitoba was wondering about the picture of Beverly LaSalle on the back cover.  You're right, the character of Beverly LaSalle died on All in the Family.  It was a poignant 2-part episode during season 8 which was called, 'Edith's Crisis of Faith'.
Shows like these will go down in the chronicles of television history and thanks to the studio companies for releasing these timepieces on DVD so the world can keep the memory of 'good television' alive today.

Archie Bunker's Place is not All in the Family, but very few sitcoms are. If you give Archie's Bunker's Place a chance you will learn it is better then most highest rated sitcoms on the Air Today in 2006. This DVD set is very good with mostly uncut Episodes as they have not been seen since they aired on CBS. Archie New Partner Part 1 seems to be the same syndicated edited version that I recorded off WPSG  CH 57in Philadelphia back in 1998 with Archie's great line to Harry about If Old McDonald had he not expanded farm into a fast food chain and that Cornel Sanders still would have been a private in the Army straggling chickens had he not taken a chance on his chicken joints were not included (These lines were kept in the TVLand edit in 2002). Other then that the rest of the episodes seems to be intact.  Great liner notes Inside the DVD with episode credits

   I have always enjoyed All In The Family and consider it one of the best TV shows ever,in any genre.This series covers the "continuing adventures of Archie Bunker".It is definitely not as good as AITF but it is a logical extention of that series,especially in light of the fact that Rob Reiner,Sally Struthers and Jean Stapleton wanted to move on to other things and only Archie would remain (Stapleton was in ABP season 1 but was phasing out of the role).
   I never saw either series in their original run (too young),but I've seen AITF many,many times in reruns and on DVD.I hadn't seen ABP since it was rerun on WLVI Channel 56 in Boston many years ago,and it is great to see it again.My girlfriend had never seen it and is a big Archie fan,and she was thrilled to get it on the day of its release.
   Don't expect to see AITF,but if you are a fan of Archie Bunker you will enjoy this series.The fact that All In The Family ended,the whole cast but Archie basically changed,the show became a spin-off continuation,and it ran for 4 top 20 seasons tells you how powerful a character Archie was.It was still in the Top 20 when CBS pulled the plug.It seems that Archie could not be stopped

I'm not sure why Sony Home Entertainment decided to start releasing "Archie Bunker's Place" on DVD before "All in the Family" was finished, nor do I know why they picked such a goofy-looking picture of Archie to put on the cover (What's up with that grin?  He looks like a doofus!).  However, I will still be purchasing this box set to go along with the AITF sets.  Even though it's not as good as the original series, it's still worthy to own, especially when the episodes are the original uncut versions.  As usual, Amazon is the best place to buy it from since it's cheaper than the brick and mortar stores and there's free shipping to boot!  Buying this release will only serve to give the publisher more faith in anything with Archie Bunker, so the rest of the AITF seasons might not be too far behind.  So, here's a good place to cast your vote for it!  You'll enjoy this set for sure

Archie Bunker is now the owner of Kelsey's Bar. In this new spin-off he changes the name of the bar, but Kelsey was the previous owner. The bar plays a major role because the title of the sitcom Archie Bunker's Place is describing the bar. On a later episode of All in the family we hear Edith say that Kelsey was Irish, so the bar was Irish. Even on the front of this DVD we see the bar in the background. This could account for the Shamrock on the cover. Its still a good spin-off but doesn't have the charm the original had

</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
Quite coincidentally, this movie was on television last night, right after I broke up with my boyfriend and he left.  We broke up because he doesn't want to leave his 25 year marriage where there are now adult children, only to enter into my family (consisting of my little boy and me), and take on head of household, parental responsibilities again.  While I was single a long time until I married (at the age of 38) he never had prolonged single time where he could be mostly self-centered.  He wants that time now.  So he left.

Unlike this movie, he doesn't walk the streets like Billy Crystal, thinking how great it is to be alone and, allegedly, a free spirit, only to "see the light" and come racing to his girlfriend to tell he that he loves her, and "when you love somebody, you want your relationship to start right now"! 

No, in my case, he left and he hasn't called (even though I asked him not to), and I'm fairly certain he is not coming back.  Very sad.

But a great movie

"When Harry Met Sally" is one of my favorite films.  It's one of those movies you can watch again and again, and never get sick of it.  Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are hilarious, and Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher are excellent in their supporting roles.  I can't recommend this movie enough.

I just finished watching When Harry Met Sally for probably the tenth time.  It's been years since I've seen it and I enjoyed watching it with a new girlfriend.  I couldn't get over the fact that I still laughed several times, almost as if I'd never seen the movie before.

My interpretation, after all these years, was that the movie showed how people and relationships evolve over the years and how this movie realistically depicted couples going through the paces of petty arguments, infatuation, etc. without stooping to sugary sentiment.  I took Harry and Sally as unique individuals with their human quirks that made them more lovable.  I didn't see them as somehow representative of "all men" or "all women."

Then I watched the extra documentary on the DVD which I had never seen until now.  Big mistake.  My new "interpretation" of the film was suddenly cast aside as I remembered that I actually didn't like this movie as much when it first came out.  

Over time I had grown to accept the fact that I could still like a movie and its characters without actually agreeing with what they said or how they behaved.  What I had forgotten was Billy Crystal's, Rob Reiner's (director) and Nora Ephron's (writer) agenda that these two characters actually were supposed to represent the genders.  Gag.

The views of the characters are presented as if they were fact.  Men supposedly always think about sex and can't be friends with women.  Most if not all women have faked an orgasm.  All men are clueless to the fakery.  And so on.

I can only hope that these dinosour views are only representative of the Boomer generation and older folks (no one on this film is even close being a member of Gen X) because this does not represent the reality of all humans.  You'll notice in the documentary that they only interview people above the age of 40 to "prove" their case.  If they'd interviewed an empowered 25 year old woman maybe she would have let them have it - "No, I won't fake it.  If he sucks in bed I'm going to tell him." And as for men, some of us younger ones are actually perceptive enough to actually know when the woman does fake it.

None of this changes this classic film.  That's the great thing about art - it's open to interpretation.  I can watch this film and define it my way - two unique and funny people who took a long time to get their act together and fall in love. Otherwise, I'd hate this movie.  But I won't give Reinder, Ephron et al that much power.  Just because they were narrow minded about gender roles doesn't mean I have to be about their film.

If you agree with the characters in the film, by all means, watch the documentary.  But if you see the movie as being about two interesting characters, pass it by.  Don't let a DVD extra taint your pov

For me this movie is a painfull thing to watch. I wish that I could give this 0 stars. The infamous fake "O" scene kind of recked true intamacy for me. It may be true that women do this but it is one of the worst kind of lie imaginable. 

One of the truths for us guys is that when we are cuddiling with a woman we fanasise that we are with the first girl we fell in love with. 

Just FYI.

Can men and women truely just be friends without sex getting in the way? That's the question the movie, 'When Harry Met Sally', asks and tries it's best to answer. This is the story of two characters that meet during a long drive to New York from the University Of Chicago. At first they can't stand each other, but they keep running into each other after years of never talking. They eventually become best friends and the previous question is put into play.

I really like this movie. This is what a lot of people would call a "chick flick", but it's a movie that guys can get into as well. Billy Crystal plays the male lead and is great in the role. He is funny, as always, and this was the first movie I had seen him in. And what can you say about Meg Ryan that hasn't been said already? Wow. Everybody loves Meg Ryan. Guys think she is beautiful and retains that 'girl next door' quality at the same time. Women just love her movies, think she's a great actress, and find her 'cute'. This was the first of her many romantic roles that would go on to define her career. I honestly couldn't think of a better actress to play this role and she does it flawlessly.

Carrie Fisher &amp; Bruno Kirby play key supporting roles here. Fisher is particularly good as Meg Ryan's best friend. Rob Reiner does another great job directing here and was really on a roll by the time this movie came out. Nora Ephron, who would later go on to direct her own 'chick flicks', wrote a great script that was basically based off of a lot of real life influences (including Reiner's divorce).

Simply put, this is a great movie to sit and watch with your girlfriend. It's one of the best romantic comedies I have ever seen. Billy Crystal &amp; Meg Ryan have great chemistry and really own this movie. It's a very funny movie and it goes to show just how different men &amp; women really are.

Special Features: There is a 35 min. documentary on the making of the movie. The movie was released in 1989, so having a documentary looking back at the movie was great. Rob Reiner, Nora Ephron, &amp; Billy Crystal do most of the talking here. Carrie Fisher has some moments. Meg Ryan doesn't appear except for old footage from '88. Overall it's a pretty good documentary and surprisingly informative.

There are also seven deleted scenes included. They are all pretty good and could have been included in the movie. You also get a music video by Harry Connick Jr. (he did the music for the movie), trailer, and an audio commentary from Rob Reiner. Not a bad collection for a genre of movie ('Romantic Comedy') that rarely gets special addition treatment

This movie is on my top 5 list.  Harry Burns' theory that men and women can never be friends because the sex always gets it the way is dead nuts accurate.  Sally tries to rebut this with a hypothetical...what if the girl is unattractive?  Then can you be friends?  To which Harry, in the spirit of all men, replies "No, you pretty much want to nail them too."  Finally, a romantic comedy with some undertones that men can appreciate.  Great movie

In 1989, a good friend told me this film was excellent. I don't know why, but it took me 17 years to act on his good advice. In a way, I'm glad. Back then I might have simply liked the film. I'm not sure I would have recognized it for the evergreen, fresh and relevant classic that it is. Now, after one viewing, I can and do.

Following their graduation from University of Chicago in 1977, Harry Burns (Billy Crystal) is kissing his college sweetheart Amanda goodbye when Sally Allbright (Meg Ryan) pulls up in her station wagon to pick him up for the 18-hour shared drive they have arranged back to New York. On the drive, Harry tells an incredulous Sally that men and women can't be friends. Men always want to sleep with women, he says, noting that she is very attractive. When she finally drops him off at Washington Square Park at the foot of Fifth Avenue, Sally tells him to have a good life.

They meet again five years later, in an airport, where Sally as Sally, now a journalist, kisses Joe goodbye. Harry, who is traveling on the same plane with Sally, is acquainted with Joe. He's a political consultant, and newly engaged to Helen. Once again, their personalities seem to clash. 

Another five years pass before Harry again spies Ally, this time in a bookstore with her friend Marie (Carry Fisher). Now, Harry is in the midst of a divorce, while Sally has split up with Joe. Over the next two years, they become the thing that Harry said men and women could never be--just friends. They try dating other people. They even try fixing one another up with their respective best friends, which brings the friends together as a couple, and leaves Harry and Sally still, just friends.

Director Rob Reiner and writer Nora Ephron created a comic masterpiece in this film, but they could not have done it without the stellar performances from Crystal, Ryan, Fisher and Bruno Kirby, who plays Harry's friend, Jess.

It's not only worth waiting for good things. Sometimes it's really nice, too.

Watching Rob Reiners movies is almost always a great pleasure. He just gets to the point, without overkilling. He hits the nerve softly. He has the touch of telling the perfect joke. He tells stories that make you believe that you are in them. A true master in his craft. When Harry Met Sally is definitely one of his best. It's a film that does not get older. It stays fresh. It's a classic. Something that has to be seen, over and over again.

It's symptomatic of middle-age, I suppose, to reflect warmly on "the good old days", and even though I never wanted to fall into that syndrome, seeing "Help" has done exactly that for me. I was a Freshman in college when the movie was released, and so it was a movie for the millions of Boomers like me, in that bizarre, wonderful time that was the mid-1960's in America. 

Others have already written far more insightfully and fully than I intend to here. Simply -- if you like the Beatles, their witty, irreverent, and intellectual sense of humor, their music, and the whole 60's "British Invasion" period, you will surely enjoy this comedy. It was one last cheerful, happy, ridiculous romp for we teenagers of the 60's before the somber, discouraging misery of Vietnam settled in for a long, long time. It could be argued that, in a sense, my generation lost its sense of humor after "Help".... If a movie like "Help" were released today it would fall flat and be ridiculed, unless it were positioned as some kind of Austin Powers spinoff and "spoof" (how sick I've become of that word) of the "Hippie" period. Would this happen because as a people we never have regained that genuinely mirthful, joyous sense of humor that we revelled in in other Richard Lester movies, like "The Three Musketeers", "A Hard Day's Night", and Franco Zefferelli's "The Taming of the Shrew"? You make your own call... my generation lived it.  

Isn't it a pity that you can't buy "Help" new anymore? Isn't it interesting that the company that produced "Help" on DVD is MPI -- which is the same company that, despite overpowering demand, somehow cannot find it possible to release an even more popular, Academy Award-winning movie from the mid-Sixties -- "Becket"? Isn't it a pity that you can't buy both "A Hard Day's Night" and "Help" as a set? Isn't it a pity that no one makes movies like "Help" anymore

This was the best movie that the beatles did it was funny and had a bit more of a plot this time. 'in the weeks that followed five more attemts were made to steal the ring.' Quite frankly my favorite attemt was number four he,he. But in 'another girl' we can only wish that Paul would wear that tshirt more often. and my stepsister finally realized that there are more rasons to like the beatles than their music. That is before John turned into mountain man\amish terrorist anyway.

Okay! Now I'll actullay reveiw the movie.
Help! was a clever movie, and had a plot! Imagine that! 
Anyway, the movie was about Ringo comming into possesion of a sacred ring. that wont come off. Sooo, Ringo must be sacrificed. So high preist Clang, and Aimee end up trying to sacrifice him. Or Clang is anyway. Aimee's trying to protect him. Prof. Foot and his assistant Algenon are after the ring too. so the beatles end up getting chased everywhere. The bahamas, the alps you know. 
Well i'm not gonna give away the ending so you'll just have to buy the movie and find out. So do it! it's worth it!

Though not the landmark that "A Hard Day's Night" was, this film is still a lot of fun, and for current and future generations shows how the Beatles looked and behaved in 1965, in full color (in fact, the color cinematography is striking throughout--should have been nominated for an Oscar).

But rather than write a regular review, this is a plea to restore the film and present it in a special edition. The laserdisc from Criterion had many more features than the now out of print DVD release, including photographs that thoroughly detail a lost, deleted scene early in the film with comedian Frankie Howerd--and this scene set up a later scene, which doesn't make as much sense until you understand the context from the deleted scene...

The later scene is the one at Scotland Yard where Klang calls Superintendent Gluck's office.  As soon as the Beatles hear the music coming over the phone they plug their ears ("It's them!"), and the inspector goes into a trance. The question is, how did the Beatles know the music came from Klang, and to plug their ears? The answer was revealed in the deleted scene. Briefly, the Beatles visit a guru played by Howerd, where Klang and his henchmen appear and use the music to put the Beatles into a trance (with Ringo incapacitated, Klang was going to cut off the drummer's finger, but is foiled by George, who for the sake of the plot was conveniently wearing earplugs and impervious to the music's hypnotic effects). Having once been exposed to the music, they knew to plug their ears in the scene at Scotland Yard. (BTW, two pictures of the deleted scene are at the film's photo section at imdb.com, and unless it has since been corrected Howerd is incorrectly identified as Brian Epstein in the photos' caption.)

Perhaps the scene has been found since the Criterion laserdisc was released, and if so it would be a very special feature. But footage aside, for me the ideal special edition DVD would have two soundtracks, with the original mono soundtrack and mixes of the songs, as well as the later stereo mixes. The original soundtrack may have also contained Foley effects over the songs(i.e. sounds outside of the dialog, like footsteps and the such--perhaps even the sound of the darts hitting the screen in the opening number?) that was eradicated when the distributors replaced the mono songs with those in stereo.

Finally the restored version would have the most glaring omission from all the DVD releases--the original aspect ratio. I recall reading quotes from the distributors of the previous releases defending the release of "Help!" in a full screen, stating that it wasn't a widescreen movie to begin with. OK, it wasn't "El Cid", but then again it wasn't as squarish as the TV screen, and viewing the previous releases you can obviously see that there is more than what is viewed full screen. There was no reason not to release it widescreen and this version MUST have that restored. (It's still amazes me that the Criterion LD was also fullscreen considering presenting discs widescreen was one of their big selling points at the time.)

I hope this doesn't get too buried under all the other reviews--in fact I hope that someone inflential sees this and takes action. Otherwise I hope someone somewhere in the Beatles' org is thinking about this and it actually happens--provided the original elements, like the mono soundtrack, aren't altogether lost.

I first saw Help! when I was in middle school, rifling through my parents' VHS collection.  My friends and I were won over by this silly comedy and the Fab Four, and I have treasured the movie ever since.  It is unfortunate that the US DVD release is out of print (I had to buy an imported version), and I hope they bring it back soon, so more people can share in the pure joy of this brilliant comedy.

The plot is pure genius in its simplicity:  a gaudy red ring gets stuck on Ringo's finger.  A sacrificial cult chases him around the world, trying to paint him red in preparation for his sacrifice.  A mad scientist is determined that he could--dare I say it?--rule the world, if he could only get the ring off Ringo's finger.  The Beatles are absolutely clueless.  So they run around the world, dodging crazy people at every turn, singing songs, and generally being hilarious.

The DVD I bought had options to watch the movie dubbed in French.  So once you've seen Help! enough times to know every line by heart, try it out in a foreign language, and laugh even harder at The Beatles speaking in French.

Go... to... THE WINDOW... GO... TO... the window..

The Beatles accomplished so much - good at music , good at recording and capturing their magic , good at transferring their personalities and appeal onto film . 

HELP ! is meant to be fun and it has some slapstick elements mostly due to Ringo's abilities as a straight man .
He was always the most honest one and he holds the film together . If anyone feels he didn't do as much as the others , then this film is the evidence to the contrary .  

The Beatles' humour style incorporates elements of the Goons and Peter Sellers , who was a friend of theirs .

Enjoy this silly film and marvel at the best of the songs in it .

HELP hit theater screens in 1965 in glorious color -- or colour, if you prefer.  The previous year's A HARD DAY'S NIGHT had budget constraints that restricted it, among other things, to black and white.  With the runaway success of A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, the ante was upped considerably to provide HELP with color negative, numerous location shoots, fabulous sets, and (what we could call today) superb music videos.

Richard Lester again took the directorial helm of this second Beatles movie.  Richard Lester films have traditionally been off beat comedies and HELP is no exception.  Unlike HARD DAY'S NIGHT, where the screenplay called for the Beatles to act through an exaggerated simulated -- and believable -- day in their lives, HELP had a cloak and daggar plot.  We find religious zealots from the mystic east chasing Ringo across southern England, Switzerland, and the Bahamas to recover a sacred sacrificial ring.  The incompetence of the pursuers is barely exceeded by the Beatles protectors: Scotland Yard.

Okay, so there is not much plot here.  HELP is basically a fun filled romp with the Beatles with some great music included.  In fact, the budget was so generous that film locations were chosen almost arbitrarily to provide the Beatles with mini vacations.

The Beatles, of course, play themselves.  Veteran actor Leo McKern is the chief villian.  Victor Spinetti, who entertained us as the television producer in HARD DAY'S NIGHT, returns as the mad scientist.  Lovable Roy Kinnear (Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, The Three Musketeers) is the professor's assistant.  Eleanor Bron (A Little Princess) and Patrick Cargill (Around the World in Eighty Days) also costar.

HELP has been re-released twice since the 1980s.  The only drawback to this film is that the original movie soundtrack was "improved."  In the original print, which occasionally shows up on AMC, the original music soundtrack, complete with background sound effects, is still present.  The new DVD release uses digitally remastered music that can be found on the CD soundtrack.  Unfortunately, not all of these versions are the same tracks from the original movie.  For example, the title song, HELP, is the version from the American Capitol LP.  The original film used the single version. The original track, which can be found on old Capitol/Apple 45 rpm singles -- as well as on the Beatles Rarities album -- is slightly faster and has a heavier vocal emphasis on the word "Help."  Other songs are missing subtle background sound effects as they were blotted out by the redubbing of the music tracks.

The DVD has a few special features including the movie trailer. It is too bad that the original black and white promotional film for the song HELP, that we see during the opening credits, (albeit without darts hitting the screen) is not included on the DVD.  

Still, the DVD is a marked improvement over the last 20 years worth of VHS releases.  In my younger years I enjoyed HELP much more than A HARD DAY'S NIGHT.  Now I am not so sure.  They are two very diverse films.  I give five stars to A HARD DAY'S NIGHT for originality and four stars to HELP for color and music

if you remember the 60s and the james bond era,then this movie needs no introduction to you..its simply sensational and holds up well as far as the era it was made in goes.

for newer viewers,it may seem confusing.
the beatles were at thier peak when they did this movie.
they were the biggest thing in music no matter what anyone says.
and they knew it.
that comes accross to some viewers as they "just did whatever they wanted"
and they certaintly did!
the james bond connection will come once the newer/younger fan sees goldfinger or thunderball...
the beatles themselves called this movie as it was..and excuse to enjoy anyplace or any plot they wanted.
a must own no matter who you are..as long as you like the beatles.
be open and enjoy

It is a pleasure to watch The Beatle's film "Help." It's easy listening, lighthearted  and a nice "snapshot" in time when they were all enjoying being at the top of their game! All the songs featured were big hits and are well woven into the framework of the movie. Nevertheless, to have another opportunity to experience the dry subtle humor of John Lennon is worth the purchase on it's own! But to know that this was one of the first exposures of Indian music for George Harrison, and to witness this milestone that influenced the rest of his musical and spiritual life, is an extremely rare treat indeed. Ringo Starr continues to entertain with his own brand of whimsical laconicism that remains unequaled and Paul McCartney is very warmly enjoyable in his portrayal of a love-struck member of the band with the lovely leading High Priestess. A must see for new and renewed fans alike

My Neighbor Totoro is a wonderful story about what happens 2 young girls and their father move into a country house to be closer to their mother, who is in a nearby hospital.  The animation is stunningly done, with both people and fantasic creatures coming alive to make the story hum.  Voice acting in the original Japanese is great and the english dub is not far behind.  This is one of the best dubs I have heard, with the English voice actors obviously 'getting' their characters and the writers did a good job of not changing the lines except where required.  

My wife and I both enjoyed this a great deal and was well recieved when given to a family with two daughters, age 6 and 2. (Causing them to buy a number of other Ghibli films)

Highly recommended

Family movies don't get much better than this.  No double-entendres, no sex/violence, and yet most (mature) adults will find it most enjoyable.  Miyazaki's animation style is always a welcome touch.  There are Japanese cultural references so the uninitiated might be confused at times, however, the story transcends most boundaries and is simply a good "friendly spirit" movie.

Kids will enjoy Totoro and his friends as well as the fact that the children are the focus and stars of the movie.  Adults will find the family situations strikingly realistic and will easily identify with (and get a chuckle out of) several conversations between parents and their children.

This is one of those movies from which you will get the "warm fuzzies."  Share it with others in your family

A good animated film, with a realistic presentation of the interaction of siblings to both enjoyable and frightful situations.  It also protrays children's ready acceptance of unusual or supernatural.  The father's unquestioning willingness to go along with and support of his kids is also quite warming

My wife,  4 year old daugthter and I all liked Spirited Away and Kiki's Delivery service, and so a friend recommended this movie to me. He said it was a great family movie. It didn't sound that interesting so I didn't purchase it right away. Finally, one day when I saw a link about it on Amazon, I decided to go for it. We had no idea what we were in for, but not one of us was disappointed. If fact, the whole family has watched Totoro at least 10 times since we bought it only a 2 months ago. My daughter espcially cannot get enough of it. It is very fun, heart warming and humorous. We recommend every family get a copy of this movie. You won't regret it. We have since collected 5 of Miazaki, and Studio Ghibli's films, and we plan to purchase more in the future. BTW, if  you like this, also check out "Wisper of the Heart", another great Studio Ghibli film. Have fun, we know you will if you watch this movie

The story was both simple and unencumbered yet soulful and sweet.  The movie has pleasant and beautiful animation (bright colors, soft lines).  The characters (and their offscreen personalities) all are present and make for a fine children's film that both children will enjoy and parents can endure (I had to sit through Pokemon movies - most of them too, yuck!).  For me, the best part of the film was the soundtrack.  Jack Johnson's tuneful songs with catchy lyrics made the film very special.  The soundtrack quickly became one of my favorite CDs.  A must see film for small children.  This film is destined to be a classic and reminded me why I loved the Curious George books when I was a child myself

Curious George is fantastic.  Although many people might think that this movie is only made for children, adults will get a kick out of this movie as well.  The music that accompanies the film is great.  It is a warm story that allows you to escape from adult life drudgery and remember what it is to explore and be curious about the world.

I didn't grow up reading Curious George books as I was little. So this movie was my first exposure to the character, and now I know everyone in my family will be reading (and watching) George for a very long time. The story was cute and touching, yet at the same time it was fun and engaging.

The animation was simple but very tasteful, giving the characters a special "glow" that made them stand out and offering numerous shots using angles that are not too usual in animated features (I particularly remember the one of George running on top of buildings trying to catch Ted -the yellow hat man- where the shot is shown from above, as if there were a flying camera focusing on George).

In the end, you feel great when the movie is over and, to keep you entertained longer, there's lots of fun extra features to even teach you how to draw George. So whether you are a parent, a kid or simply an admirer of nice animated stories, Curious George is a winner for all

*Curious George* was a cute movie.  Overall, I enjoyed it.  It was a simple storyline with George, along with his curiosity, getting himself and the man in the yellow hat in trouble.  Anyways, I had a couple of good laughs.

Even though this movie was geared towards kids, you could pick up a couple of lines that were meant for adults.  

It was a bit puzzling to see Ted (the man in the yellow hat) as a goofball.  Nonetheless, it worked well into the movie.

...and George named after George Washington?!?!?  

Anyways, like I said, cute movie that anyone will enjoy.

My four year old loved this movie. The plot was very simple and easy to follow, nothing too complicated for her. The animation was also great for the movie's target audience, very soft and warm. It's a good-hearted little film and George is such a sweet, funny and cute little guy throughout. It was light on plot, probably easily predictable by anyone over the age of six, but such a cute movie that I didn't get bored watchingn it with her. This is a great movie for young children

This a very well done remake of a children book.  It kept thing simple with the basic idea of George being curious (running into trouble/ adventure) in search for the Man in the Yellow Hat.  I never felt the storyline or voice-acting were every over the top like the Cat in the Hat.  Not as fanatic as CG and other animations coming out this days.  I would recommend this as a solid family movie.

DVD problem:
There is some issue with this movie on older DVD set in which it does not play or freeze/ skip.  This is very annoying base on a new type of encoding.

Why did I watched a children movie, just curious how George has grown?   Curious George doesn't talk if you were wondering, but the Man in the Yellow Hat does.

Well, I rented this movie for my seven year old step-daughter because I grew up on Curious George and wanted to share that adventure with her. As well, she only speaks spanish and this movie has a spanish language track. I watched the movie before her to hear it in english. I tell you, I was swept in from the DVD menu. This is an absolutely adorable movie, from the animation, the voices of Wil Ferrel and others, to the music, to the way too cute Curious George, to the wonderful feel of the story. There are even some nice lessons about honesty and love. Personally, I loved this movie, and I'm 40 years old. The spanish voice overs were very well done as well, and my daughter also loved the movie, although I laughed out loud more often than her. I'll be waiting for the sequel.

I couldn't get into this movie. It was boring, too long, and I couldn't wait for it to be over with. George was annoying and he should've been tranquilized and thrown into the zoo. The only thing I liked about the movie was the use of computer animation to enhance the traditional cartooning

Well loved children's character Curious George is now on DVD in a brand new feature length adventure. Curious George the animated feature includes the voice talent of Drew Barrymore and Will Ferrell. Kids won't really care who lends voice talent to this gem.

As the film begins, Ted, the Man in the Yellow hat is seen working a museum when the museum is suddenly in a financial crisis. To save the museum, Ted is summoned to the museum curator's office and sent on a mission to Africa to look for a mysterious item that will bring visitors back to the museum. Ted heads to the Outback Outfitter store where he is fitted with his trademark yellow suit.

Once he arrives in Africa with the crew, Ted is shocked to discover what they felt would be a huge item that would save the museum, is actually a small little statue that fits into the palm of his hand. Ted does meet a curious, fun little brown monkey. As he leaves Africa set for the shores of America, the little monkey, who has taken his yellow hat, stows away on the ship. Soon after he arrives back home, Ted discovers that the little monkey, who he names George is a part of his life at home.

Kids will really love this film--mine did. The DVD also includes some cool bonus features. The games are easy to play with the DVD remote. There are also DVD-ROM features. The running time of Curious George is one hour and twenty eight minutes.

This is another american remake of the original Danish movie, starring Stellan Skarsgard, which is more interesting than this remake. I always wonder why, when Hollywood does a remake, they change the things that make the movie interesting in the first place. Even though I give this remake 4 stars, mainly because Al Pacino and Robin Williams restrained themselves, and that Hollywood changed the ending. Check out the original. I give the Danish original 5 stars.

I am amazed and mystified that most of the reviewers herein found the movie to be excellent!! As for me, I made it about thirty minutes into the film before turning it off in dismay. The fault in order of importance: poor screenplay, poor cinematography and poor performance by Pacino, who seems to be vying for the most over-the-top performance. The film was absurd in many ways from the outset: the pans from star to star lasting just short of giving the viewer any purpose for any of the fast camera pans. Close-up after close-up conveying no meaning, Pacino overacting like Jack Palance in one of his not-so-famous European pieces of tripe from the sixties and seventies, an utterly dumb plot with Pacino and company proving at the beginning that they are bumbling cops. 

First example, they chase the bad guy to a cabin which is on stilts or something like that; then, instead of staying on the ground below and smoking the bad guy out or something at least tactically sound, they storm the stairs and Pacino stands right in front of the door yelling "Police, you're under arrest."

They kick in the front door and find that the culprit has escaped through an underground water source. Of course, Pacino follows and dives right into the underwater stream, having absolutely no idea where the guy is or if there are boobytraps of some sort. 

Cut to Pacino running around in nearly zero visibility fog, glimpsing the guy for a second or two before losing him in the fog. Stumbling around further, Pacino is obviously disoriented until a shot is fired at him from, we must assume, his quarry. Did the screen writer forget that Pacino's colleagues are also supposedly chasing the culprit, too? 

Inevitably and apparently not, because Pacino spots a figure in the fog and plugs him. As I watched this scene unfold, I became thoroughly disheartened when it becomes clear what I knew already, that Pacino has fired on and killed his partner. It was then that I decided that I had had enough. 

By the way, the European version, with Stellan Skarsgaard is infinitely superior. Don't waste your money or on-line rental queue on this Hollywood drivel. Ditto for the other Pacino junk I rented at the same time, The Recruit, which I could only stand for about a half hour too

Insomnia is quite simply about a web of lies, and the consequnces they can produce. It is very well acted on both Pacino's and Williams part, and Swank was brilliant as well. Besides all that good stuff, I am also a fan of the director, "ever since I saw Batman Begins" and find his artistic vision to be incredible.

The only problem I had with this movie was the ending. Sure, it showed how lying could defeat a person, but I thought a little redemption would have been nice.

However, if you have a strong stomach, or a good editing company, I suggest you see this.

Al Pacino plays the morally conflicted police officer with some secrets who is doing his best to help solve a murder in Alaska during the long days of summer when the sun never sets. 
The white landscape and the gray mental clarity from his insomnia make this an interesting psychological morality tale.

</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
It's not just that this film is a bloated remake of a quick, clean, near-perfect minimalist thriller. It's not that much of the added material (particularly the internal affairs sub-plot) feels tacked-on and unnecessary. It's not even that Pacino's character is a toned-down shell of the dangerously off-kilter detective of the original, that one of the more complicated characters (Frya Selmer/Tanya Francke) has been reduced down to set dressing, or that the ending ruins the film's moral atmosphere. It's the fact that Nolan, a sublimely talented director, is unable to coax a believable performance from any of his leads. Pacino does the method-acting bit again, taking it over the top in every single scene; Hilary Swank plays a pale imitation of her better roles as the down-to-earth hometown girl; and Robin Williams--well, he's Robin Williams. The kids in this film, Katharine Isabelle and Jonathan Jackson, turn in fine performances that, while hardly career-makers (which they couldn't be, considering how far their roles have been pared down), are a refreshing change of pace from their adult contemporaries' mugging. See the film for their far-too-short performances, but make sure you rent it, and don't pay too much to do so

 Christopher Nolan's "Insomnia" is a fantastic film, that manages to top the original. This police thriller is hypnoticly enthralling from beginning to end. Al Pacino has one of his best roles in years.(He's still the man!) Robin Williams was better in "One Hour Photo", but he's not glaringly miscast as others claim.The rest of the cast is first-rate, with Hillary Swank being particularly good. The credit for this film's greatness belongs to Director Nolan. He's created a tense,visually unique picture that transcends genre cliches, and stands as one of the best movies of the decade.

This is one of the "big" 1960s Warner Bros. musicals.While definitely not in the same class as "My Fair Lady" or "The Music Man",it's as good as "Finian's Rainbow" and MUCH better than "Camelot".Leonard Speigelgass's script wisely lets Arthur Laurents' book virtually speak for itself.John Beckman and Ralph Hurst's sets,Orry-Kelly and Howard Shoup's costumes,Harry Stradling's photography,and Frank Perkins's musical direction are all excellent.Mervyn LeRoy's direction is very good,
especially in the dramatic scenes.The cast is excellent,with
Rosalind Russell,Natalie Wood,and Karl Malden particularly 
outstanding.
Faith Dane,Roxanne Arlen,and Jean Willes stop the show with a
hilarious "You Gotta Get A Gimmick".All in all,a good 1960s 
musical that provides an evening of solid entertainment

My mother took me to the movies to see Gypsy, starring Rosalind, when I was about 10 years old.  I fell in love with the movie.   Natalie Wood became a beautiful swan.  I just love that movie.  I watched the movie with my daughter although she had seen it on tv with all the commercials.  She enjoyed it so much I am going to purchase her a copy.

Based on the hit Broadway play, Mervyn LeRoy directed this under-appreciated musical gem. Rosalind Russell is Mama Rose, the mother of all stage mothers, grooming her two young daughters for stardom on the vaudeville stage. She pays special attention to her youngest child, blond Baby June, while Louise is relegated to the background. As time goes on, the vaudeville craze fades with the coming of talkie films, and now her bubbly blond darling, Danity June (Ann Jilliann), is desperate to break free, deserting the family act. Rose is forced to start from scratch, with wallflower Louise (Natalie Wood, who was always in her sister's shadow), as the headliner in a new act, which basically goes nowhere. One day, Rose and her troop, now called Rose Louise and her Hollywood Blondes, wind up in a burlesque theater, and young Louise finds herself drawn into the the role of a stripper. She sheds her shy persona and becomes the world's most famous stripper, Gypsy Rose Lee.

Ethel Merman originated Rose on the stage, but Roz Russell does more than an adequate job, despite the fact that her singing voice was dubbed in some musical numbers. She is strong, overbearing, a little eccentric, but at the same time, she commands the audience's sympathy when she realizes that her ambition has just driven her daughters away, and she finds herself alone, with no one to live through anymore. Natalie Wood gives a touchingly vulnerable performance, her thin but endearing singing voice expressing Louise's pain and confusion in extraordinary volumes. Since she was groomed by an obsessive stage mother herself, Wood really had the the material to draw from; her lessons from the real Gypsy Rose Lee undoubtedly helped in her character's transformation from a shy girl to sophisticated stripper (the striptease numbers are fabulous). Who doesn't shed her a tear when she sings, "Little Lamb", or feels enthralled as she performs "Let Entertain You"? As she studies herself before a mirror prior to her first night on the burlesque stage, she sees her beauty for the first time - "I'm pretty - I'm a pretty girl, Mama!" When she makes her mark, she engages in an argument with her controlling mother, bringing both to a heartache, and later, an understanding. "You really could have been something, Mother," Louise informs Rose after catching a bit of her "performance" on the empty stage.

Having seen the 1993 version starring Bette Midler, I still prefer this one; no matter what anyone says, Roz is not miscast, and this film does not, in my opinion, have any "clumsy" moments; it is a vintage Hollywood musical. Karl Malden gives a comedic and committed performance as Rose's suitor Herbie, who wants her to marry him and who wants to provide a home for her kids. A young Morgan Brittney plays little Baby June; seeing her makes you think of her as the "Jon Benet" of the 1920s. It's finally on DVD, as it deserves to be; the letterbox enhances the film in a way that pan-and-scan videos never could.

Everything's coming up roses . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

I loved this version as a little girl , and grew up with it.
I usually do not comment on others reviews , but I feel I MUST respond to a comment ,that this version of Gypsy is definately NOT a classic.SO WRONG ! How could anyone say this masterpiece is NOT a classic ??

It is the role that made Natalie Wood a star!
The movie is wonderful,and as far as Roz not having a good singing voice,I believe that was done ON PURPOSE.I am quite sure the producer/director knew she had a rough voice. She portrayed a "tough broad" as some might say , who was street smart , and some songs don't have the typical "good voice" to them - Look at Joe Cockers "You are so beautiful" His voice cracks more than once , and especially at the end of the song, and THAT song STAYED number one for a very long time , and is still a classic today...so yes , her voice is rough , but again I say , that was intentional.Her whole demeanor was rough around the edges.

As far as all the characters being mismatched , I feel quite the contrary. They meshed beautifully.The movie has that wonderful nostalgic quality that puts you right there , and you really feel for all of the characters. 

This musical has such DEPTH , Great acting/singing , It's fun , and snappy ,and happy ,and sad ,and ... just everything that movies today aren't .This musical is pure entertainment ,It actually takes you away and puts you right there ,feeling all the emotions of the characters :The sadness of Mama's favortism toward June. Louise's anger toward her mama, The Mama's sadness at Louise's rejection of her after she becomes a stripper. The sadness of Joe(?) (It's been so long I can't even remember if this was his name) when Roz wouldn't marry him. The upbeat song "Mama get married today" and the so very sad song "Little hen Little fish" that Louise sang to her Birthday present...you definately get caught up in the performances.

I say , If you've never seen it: Watch it. If you HAVE seen it: Revisit it again. It is like seeing an old friend. I haven't seen it in a long time, but I have looked for it in different stores under musicals or classics, and I can never find it. Hopefully I can find a copy on Amazon.

I always wished they would make a Gypsy 2 set in that era , but of course , even if they did , it couldn't touch the original...Which brings me back to my point in the beginning , It is a CLASSIC , and a great one at that , and always will be.
I just wish I could give it TEN stars

I give this version 2 stars, 1 for Natalie Wood, who is superb, and 1 for the story itself. Rosiland Russell who was a great actress,(Auntie Mame, The Women), but definately not a singer, is miscast big time!! If they had done the right thing and cast Ethel Merman, the combination of Merman and Natalie Wood would make this a classic today, which it definately is not. The Bette Midler version is far superior

I love "Gypsy." I remember seeing this film when I was 7 with my Mom and Sister,and it was condemed by the Catholic church.My Mom was so worried she would go to hell when she found out later this was on the list of movies not to see.Everyone is fantastic,and I love Natalie Woods performance,but this is Rosalind Russell's movie.She's so funny,and the energy this women had is unreal,and for a person who can't sing,I could hear her version of "Everythings comming up Rosses" everyday,and still enjoy it.This is a Classic,and I'm going to watch this DVD again tonight

The catch phrase used repeatedly in this 1962 Warner Bros screen version of the Broadway classic "Gypsy" is "let me entertain you!", and that is certainly what this wonderful musical succeeds perfectly in doing. Boasting off screen credentials such as Stephen Sondheim for lyrics, choreography by Jerome Robbins and direction by Hollywood veteran Mervyn Leroy, with a superb cast from the legendary Rosalind Russell, through to Natalie Wood and Karl Malden, you just know this movie is going to be something special. Debate still rages over the casting of Rosalind Russell in the central role of the stage mother from hell, Rose Hovick in place of Broadway legend Ethel Merman who had one of her greatest Broadway triumphs in the role. In much the same way as Audrey Hepburn's casting as Eliza Doolittle over Julie Andrews in "My Fair Lady" drew heated discussion, the debate over "Gypsy", will undoubtedly continue forever. Rosalind Russell certainly makes the central character of the pushy, dominering stage mum her own here and provides in my belief much of what is memorable in this film version of the classic story. Indeed "Gypsy", still has that warm appealing show biz flashiness about it that makes a viewing a wonderful nostalgic experience. There have been many back stage stories filmed but "Gypsy", is certainly one of the best of it's kind and boasts many fine qualities that allow it to stand on it's own artistic merits side by side with its illustrious Broadway parent.

"Gypsy", of course recounts the rise to notoriety of one of last centuries most famous burlesque queens, the one and only Gypsy Rose Lee. Of course the most colourful character in the story and the one most prominently featured in Arthur Laurent's book on which the play was based was that of the mother the unstoppable Momma Rose Hovick who was unrelenting in her push to see her daughters as stars of the vaudeville circuit. The film chronicles the ambitions of Momma Rose through a long series of performing engagements across America where the spot light is always on the youngest of the three times married Rose's two daughters, June. In an act headlined by "Baby" June (Morgan Brittany billed as Suzanne Cupito), who slowly develops through the years into "Dainty", June (Ann Jillian) the format never changes and finds elder daughter Louise reduced to being the front end of a cow prop used in the act. Rose has an unfailing belief in the talent of her daughters and brushes aside the attentions of besotted manager Herbie Sommers(Karl Malden), because he wants to marry Rose, settle down and give the girls a proper home in one place. As the years go by the families fortunes take a turn for the worst and the great Depression wipes out the last vestiges of the old vaudeville circuit. Living from hand to mouth "Dainty June", becomes tired of always playing a child and runs off and gets married. Rose turns her attention on the less extroverted Louise and revamps the act to spotlight her. However all the magic has gone and when the troupe are booked in as a support act at a burlesque theatre the whole group's lives are changed forever. Louise is dragged in to replace a missing act and despite it involving a strip tease number Rose sees the chance for Louise to gain star status and thus "Gypsy Rose Lee", is born. Louise becomes an unexpected sensation and celebrity in burlesque however Rose begins to feel shut out and having also lost Herbie who tired of waiting for her to marry him she sees a lonely old age on her own ahead of her. However in the best tradition of show business a reconciliation occurs at the eleventh hour which sees the overpowering Momma Rose back in her daughters life for a happy finale. 

Coming on the heels of its Broadway predecessor this movie version does not suffer at all for the changes in cast. Rosalind Russell a fine comedian from right back in the 1930's does a wonderful job of bringing this monsterous but still likeable stage mother to life. The character is essentially a combination of many notorious Broadway and Hollywood stage mothers and she brings her great comic skills to the forefront to make Rose the most meaty character in the story. What is important about Russell's performance is that she always manages to bring the deep down humanity behind the ruthless ambition into her playing of Rose and her scenes towards the end of the film when Gypsy has discarded her are nothing short of brilliant in turning audiences sympathies back onto her character. Natalie Wood, one of Hollywood's most beautiful young women of the time plays the central role of Gypsy and she displays just the right elements of awkwardness and vulnerability in her early scenes combined with the supreme confidence she displays in the later scnes when she is a great success as a burlesque Queen. She has great chemistry with Rosalind Russell and their scenes when the power base in the relationship changes are especially noteworty. Karl Malden has the difficult role of Herbie, Rose's long time love and he makes great dramatic worth out of his decades long love for a woman more interested in turning her children into stars than getting married to him. His departure scene when he finally says goodbye to Rose is particulary poignant. Finally young Ann Jillian deserves special mention for her wonderful playing of "Dainty", June, Momma's favourite who is never allowed to grow up in the act. The scenes of her as a teenager still playing a baby are both comical and tragic if there is such a thing possible. The overall production of "Gypsy", does great credit to its Broadway parent and the period recreation over many decades, stunning costumes designed by the legendary Orry Kelly and the wonderful choreography by Jerome Robbins is first rate. Despite her different singing style to Broadway's Ethel Merman, Russell handles the musical numbers with relish including "Everthing's Coming Up Roses", "Some People", "You'll Never Get Away From Me",and "Rose's Turn".

While I'm not an authority on Broadway musicals I always find "Gypsy", has a fresh and endearing quality to its story that while being at times brash is also sensitive and moving in its quieter moments. Would Ethel Merman have made the part of Rose a truly memorable creation in the movie version? Who knows but what we have here is one of the better early 1960's Hollywood musicals that succeeds on many different levels. Put some time away soon and catch this great Hollywood musical, Rosalind Russell is sure to dazzle you with her energy, and with the uniqueness of her stage mum to end all stage mums, enjoy!!!

Without a doubt, Dave Chappelle created one of the greatest shows to air on television, but I might just be saying too much...or not. Everything he does will crack you up and if it doesn't you have no sense of humor. While I don't have the first season yet, I have seen the whole thing, and it is worth the purchase 100%.

Dave Chappelle isn't a blind comedian who let's power get in his way. He knows what's best for him and that is another reason why he is one of the best comedians in America today. There are many hilarious sketches that somehow were beat by the next season, but that's no reason to skip this set!

This contains all the episodes fully uncensored, as we want them and funny as h e l l commentary by Dave and Neal. There are also bonus features that need your attention. There is no thinking over to do, go buy it now

    this was and still is one of the best skit comedy shows out at the time. dave's natural gift of comedy is very well suited to this outrageous and howling,profaine,and insightful show. mr. chappelle has taken some great bits and turned skit comedy on it's ear! this set isn't for everyone,but if like me the skit of the blind,black white supermacist(watch to understand) is just the funniest bit i have seen in years.
     like i said this is not for all taste as the laungage is very corse and the skits are very much geared for adults(keep the kids away!!!), but for those with the sence of humor to like dave this is a great collection to have!

The  Chapelle show is equal parts hit or miss or near-miss. 

For every brilliant sketch that has you simultaneously shaking your head in amazement while you slap your knee in amusement (a hit), there is a bit where you just shake your head at how embarrasingly lame it is. (The miss.) And then there are the solid bits that are pretty funny, but no great shakes.

HITS: A blind black white supremacist? Genius. And for some reason, I love the musical interlude where Dave and Mos Def cruise around while Mos Def raps.
NEAR MISS: The Real World sketch with a white guy staying with some of the most criminal blacks that Dave and his writers could concoct was so "real" and cruel, it was just brutal... yet kind of funny too.
MISS: Lots and lots of lame sketches

This is the funniest show i've seen since Mad TV. Dave Chappelle is a genius. I put him up with Chris Rock and Eddie Murphy any day.

This dvd was crazy. I really loved the Crack Head (Tyrone Biggums). You really need to get this dvd. You do not know what you are missing!!!!

After being thouroughly amused by Chapelle's Show Season 2 on DVD I purchased the Season 1 DVD box set, since I had only seen a few shows from the debut series.  While this is a worthy set to own, it's not as funny as the second season.  Few of the skits will have a lasting effect on you and just arent memorable.  It's funny but just not as funny as the season 2 DVD box set

I really didn't think I was going to like this show, but it's actually pretty good.  It isn't the funniest thing I've ever seen, but it's well done, decently funny, the characters come across as real people for the most part, and there isn't any smug condescension towards them.  The performances are good for this type of thing.  Some of my favorite moments are Thomas Lennon's closeted gay cop getting his bike stolen constantly, the jokes the cops play on unsuspecting motorists (like arresting the pizza delivery guy so they could take his pizza), the episode where the "homeland security" guy fools all of the Reno police department, and when the FBI comes in for a murder investigation, and reduces the department to a bunch of gophers.  You're not going to see groundbreaking, brilliant satire here, but you won't be bored, either.  Overall, a decent series.

When you love being with the characters of a show, does the plot-line matter?  The answer is 'yes' if you are a fan of the only reality show on TV, 'COPS.'

Much like the comedy classics 'WKRP,' 'Mary Tyler Moore,' 'Cheers' and others, 'Reno 911' gives us characters who are fun to be with.  They are confused, silly, illogical, occasionally dim-witted and even racist at times.  A camera zooms in on any one of them seemingly out of nowhere at a moment's notice and shows us glimpses of them engaged in petty workplace back-stabbing, gossip or romance.  In the meantime, they are all in sheriffs' department uniform, crashing the police car, conducting stings that go wrong, firing their guns with reckless abandon, deciphering vanity plates on cars while in high-speed pursuit, and chasing bizarre criminals around Reno or its trailer parks.  (In addition to being on the Reno police force, Niecy Nash, also the star of the home improvement show 'Clean House,' provides face-blurred cameos of a wacko woman with a penchant for disturbing the peace and stealing police cars and weapons.  In the final episode, watch for Garcia, played by Carlos Alazraqui, to lose it and disappear off-camera laughing hysterically at Ms. Nash's escapades.)

I discovered 'Reno 911' while channel-flipping and tuned in for a few repeat episodes because a) it was truly funny, and, b) was a spoof of one of my all-time favorite shows, 'COPS.'  I had never bought a television-show-on-DVD before and decided that I wanted to give this one a try and watch this particular series sequentially and commercial free beginning with episode 1.  I am so glad I did.  Thankfully, there is no laugh track, nor is there one on TV either.  Each episode is skillfully and evenly written and produced, very funny and stands alone.  (Some episodes also include audio commentary.)

This stuff works.  Highly recommended for all students of comedy and fans of 'COPS.

I was first introduced to this show by a friend in the USA (I'm in Australia) who asked if I'd seen it. No, I hadn't. Then I saw an episode on cable in a hotel and I knew what he was talking about.

The situations are great - lots of improv but you'd never know it - it's very natural. 

This show is the funniest on tv, I bought a multi-region DVD player just so I could watch this. I know some Cops who have seen it and they say it's funny as hell. You can't get much better than that. Lot's of "in" jokes for real Cops too. If you know a cop, buy it for them!

I love the start of shift briefings - quickdraw to see who has to go out and buy lunch. THAT is funny

Reno 911 is one of the best comedy spoofs on television today.  The comedy is original and catches the viewer unaware.  The set-up of the jokes and the visual punch lines provide a new type of comedy entertainment, in the same way as the Monty Python routines broke new comedy ground.  The actors of Reno 911 portray a wonderful combination of sterotypes that significantly enhance the full-force humor of the series.  Few TV comedy shows have ever arrived at the level of Reno 911.  When watching Reno 911, you don't just smile, you don't just chuckle, you laugh out loud and in this day and time, "it don't get much better than that."

This show is one of the funniest on comedy central today.  It's full of over-the-top, sick humor that just keeps you laughing through each episode.  Definately worth buying the first season on dvd

This is the first novel of John Grisham and like the movie, it's very strong in characters and dialogue. At the time he wrote it, there was some pretty good attempts at making good 'lawyer' movies. "Witness for the Prosecution" comes to mind. And we had uncovered a whole raft of great new mystery writers like Parker, Crais, Lehane, George, and Grafton. But the legal-mystery novel was uncharted land and Grisham plowed it over with a passion. How was Grisham to know that like the fall of communism had given "evil empire" writers like Len Deighton and John LeCarre fits, eventually the public would tire at lawyers, even laughing at them? 

Nevertheless, it's a good book and also an excellent movie. If there are drawbacks, then truthfully there are some areas that require a little trust. The lawfirm itself for example. Sexual misconduct in a lawfirm? Sure. Misconduct in billing? Always. Stealing from the evidence locker of ill gotten gains? Occasionally. But murdering associates who try to leave? I don't think so. (But it does give Department of Justice cop Ed Harris a great line in the movie, "McDeere, no one has left your firm alive!")

The movie has a solid script and a great cast to carry it. The lovely Jeanne Tripplehorn, the this time not very grandfatherly Wilfred Brimley, Holly Hunter, always a hoot, Gary Busey, Hal Holbrook and Law and Order's Steven Hill, to mention a few. And Tom Cruise as always doing a powerful job who suddenly realizes that the pot of gold at the end of his and Abbey's rainbow has a HAZMAT sticker on it that he's overlooked. Cruise is just great. A true Hitchkockian character, the average man with no where to run.

What would you do if you found that the company you had waited for all your life was evil from top to bottom? That's The Firm. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebur

Nothing can be better than "The Firm" written by John Grisham, who himself is a lawyer. The attentions to details that Grisham manages to pull are just fantastic. I read the book before watching the movie, and hence can compare and tell that the movie has been directed perfectly and in fact a lot more interesting than the book, as the book gets slow in between, but not the movie. 

Cruise's is superb, so are the other actors in this movie. I don't know why people have given negative reviews by comparing it with real life scenarios. This is a movie based on a fiction novel, and as rightly said by one of reviewer here;it does its job by entertaining the audiences.

The story gets a bit complicated because it deals a little bit with law issues. The real problem is that most of us get kind of frightened when we face something unusual in our daily lives. I had to watch the movie's end twice in order to understand well how the bad guys were going to be punished. I wonder what lawyers, FBI agents and mafia members would think when watching this movie. 

Most of us don't know much about legal issues but are still interested in thrillers, and this movie shows a rather believable and very fun plot. The good guy, Mitch McDeere, wins over evil not only because he's smart but also because of a big deal of good luck. Mitch is so lucky that the story strains credibility.For example, Mitch's wife gets to know all of a sudden that Gene Hackman's character (who has important documents to copy) is not going to dive as Mitched though so she saves the days by showing up to distract him. Well, good luck tends to favor people with drive in real life.   At the same time the movie shows legal procedures made-up by real life lawyer John Grisham. 

The movie is also realistic in the way the bad guys are punished. In real life white-collar criminals hardly ever go to jail, even less killed by the good guys; everybody knows this. What not everybody knows is that these crooks can still face problems. The movie shows the sort of legal and money problems they get involved into.

Finally, the suspense is well organized. Moreover the piano and instrumental music goes really well in those scenes. 

Yes, this is very compelling movie to recommend watching. Beware that this movie deals at some degree with the Conservative vs Liberal cultural war. The bad guys had to be the Southern Conservatives who want to rule other people's lives according to their own hypocrite standards. Meanwhile the good guys are Liberals from NE. I wondered how writer John Grisham could portray his own Southern fellows in negative ways. All I guess is that JG realized what would be accepted by the Entertainment industry and wrote according to it. Anyways, this is just a movie and it does what it's supposed to do: to entertain

This is a smartly written and fast-paced drama.  Tom Cruise plays a sharp young Harvard grad lawyer who must use all his skills to out smart the mob.  Great supporting help from Gene Hackman and Wilford Brimley is chilling as one of the mob security directors.

I hate lawyers.

What is a lawyer, anyway? Basically: it's a telemarketer in a decent suit, a guy who would be hawking the latest Ronco Hair-in-a-Can super-duper late night special to folks in Akron over his plantronic headset, only he won the genetic lottery and got shot out of an upper-middle class womb. 

Shakespeare said it first and best: "First, let's kill all the lawyers!". Former Enron uber-dealmaker John Wing put a little fast-times Houston spin on that one: "get all the lawyers in a room---and shoot 'em!---in the mouth, so you *can't* miss!" 

Exactly. Anyway, "The Firm" is a flick that purports to make the world of high-priced yappers jaw-rippingly exciting, so I was probably all amped up to despise it. 

But not really: back before I dug into a gig with the Dark Side in high finance, back when I was hefting a backpack over the sodden campus of my old alma mater, I briefly considered going into law: briefly, for about an hour. It was a desperate time, and I needed money. 

Why did I consider walking Hell's Highway, if only for an instant? Because John Grisham, boring lawyer-turned-ripping-potboiler-writer-turned-back-into-boring-lawyer, a kind of Tom Clancy for the paper-pusher and green-eyeshade set, made it all sound pretty damned funky (and lucrative! Hey, dig that BMW 7 series, baby, beep beep!) in his engrossing little novel "The Firm": granted, I've read better prose on the backs of cereal boxes, but it held my attention. 

I mean, seriously: you're 19, and the whole flying out on the corporate Lear to Grand Cayman and switching out briefcases full of cash sounds kinda cool. And strippers, man, plenty of strippers. Oh, and did someone mention a BMW?

What's the difference between a lawyer and a snake? The snake at least has the decency to hiss before it sinks its fangs into your a**. 

Now it's true: Grisham writes like Kim Jong Il sings, but---in "The Firm", anyway---he was a master craftsman at moving things along at a bristling pace, from the pedestrian---hotshot Law School whiz kid gets picked up by a Memphis white-shoe law firm---to the Pretty Damned Atrocious, all while keeping the pressure ratcheted up with a dense, suffocating sense of malice. 

Grisham, like Michael Crichton, isn't a prose genius: he's not even mediocre. But he writes for film, and "The Firm" cried out for cinematic treatment. 

So it's baffling that, with all the right Stuff---Tom Cruise as winsome lead Mitch McDeere, Gene Hackman doing his chain-drinking Gene Hackman thang as the corrupt (but ultimately worn-out and pathetic) senior partner, and Sydney Pollack helming it up---that the big-screen treatment of "The Firm" is such a yawner. 

Talk about contempt of court.

Pollack takes all that intricately woven little Grisham-plot and barfs big ugly chunks of it up on the screen. At its guts, really, "The Firm" was really nothing more than the Big Career Nightmare: I've bet the farm on this gig, I'm getting big money, I'm working like a fiend, my wife is having trouble remembering my name, and evidently I'm not doing tax-deals for loaded clients---I'm doing money laundering for The Mob. 

Pollack just mangles the whole thing, convolutes the simple, and renders up a flick that will have you checking your watch and yawning. Casting is part of the problem: Cruise does his thing, running around Memphis with his briefcase. Hackman drinks a lot and exudes pure Armani-clad sleaze: "The Firm" is all funny-wrinkles when he's onscreen, but hey, a man can only do so much. 

Jeanne Tripplehorn (Cruise's squeeze), who plays Lara San Giacomo when she's not playing Tripplehorn (seriously, google the two of 'em: astounding!) is a bitter old battleaxe who made me want to stick forks in my eyes. Wilford Brimley is just plain wrong as The Firm's security chief: too bald, too cracker, too rotund, too silly, too low-end, to do the role justice. 

Holly Hunter is even worse: Hunter is one of those eighties thangs who got pumped up as Something Sexy, which is baffling, given that she's about 3'8, and has all the sex appeal of an Oompah-Loompah. It doesn't help that she's a big, ugly Southern stereotype, the caricature most denizens of dumpy Michigan towns imagine Southerners to be. You want her to die: she doesn't. Pollack wants us to think she's clever and funny. She isn't. 

Ed Harris, I think, is in this movie. So is Hal Holbrook, which kinda ruins everything, because everytime Hal Holbrook is in a movie you know you're dealing with a bunch of friggin' crooks.  

Anyway, the coup de grace to the stupidity is the entrance, Deus Ex Machina, of Paul Sorvino (Don Morolto---what kind of Goombah name is dat, anyway? Somebody call Tony Soprano!), who takes this juggernaut of boredom from the merely stupid to the totally ridiculous. 

If you wanna see Tom Cruise running around Memphis with his briefcase for two hours, by all means belly up to the bar. 

Otherwise, case dismissed.

I read the book and then re-read the book. I saw the movie not once but twice.  It is somewhat different from the book. I like Pollock  a lot, his movies are so interesting to me that I could'nt wait for the movie to come out.  The acting was well done only one flaw. Casting Tom Cruise in this otherwise well developed movie.  Everyone else does a great job of acting here.  To me though, Tom is miscasted.  He seems to be out of place.  His thinking is good and his intentions are what the character is suppose to be but He just did'nt click of what Sidney wanted the character to be and do.  Sorry Cruise fans he is wasted as far as I am concerned.  Gene Hackman, and as well as Ed Harris they did well.  A great movie but could have been better without Cruise here

If you're looking for exciting chase scenes, gratutious nudity, explicit sex scenes, and formulaic mega-spectacle, then this one is not for you.  But, you will love this movie if you love dance, dancers, searchers for true love, cynics whom true love find, oddballs who find their one true soul mate, and good guys who win in the end.  All in one underrated and underreviewed masterpiece.  Ignore the naysayers.  Take a chance and see this one.  Share it with someone you love.  You will not regret it

I love this film (obviously being able to understand the dialogue helps a lot), to me it's the quintessential Brit flick - absolutely what we do best - but I don't consider it a Rom Com at all.  It's very bitter sweet, and if all you're seeing is the funny stuff on the surface then you're missing the point of this film.  Every character had a dark thread running through them, a secret pain or guilt or just sorrow at wrong turnings made.  But it's also about hope, and the message that I get from this film is that no matter what disasters lie in your past, you can always overcome them or redeem yourself.

Adrian Lester was, as always, wonderful at the emotional epi-centre of the film.  BTW if you ever get the chance to see him do Shakespeare on stage then move heaven and earth to go, he is a sensational actor who absolutely understands how to act 'the beats inbetween'.

So, my advice is to look past the tabasco jokes and see the real film

Hubby and I have finally solved our problem of being unable to understand English accents that are other than what one hears on the BBC and are referred to as "posh" or upperclass.  We now turn on the English subtitles and watch them that way.  It used to be that fifteen minutes into a movie like this we'd be turning it off because we had such trouble understanding them.  With the advent of English subtitles being on all DVDs, those days are over.  The film is a relationship film set in London and involves rougly 7 different men and women and their attempts to get together through the use of their local Salsa dance club.  Every character in here has relationship problems but they tend to be funny ones.  There is minimal contact with the world of divorce and even less with the world of single parenting.  Instead, these are all singles trying to connect and flopping fabulously at it most of the time.  Each character has his or her own eccentricity which is well handled too.  I can't say I need to own this film but for an evening's viewing, it was a lot of fun.  There are two men who play cab drivers in a restaurant who have some absolutely hilarious dialogues with one another.  They aren't part of the other action but as comedy sketches, their scenes together are gems

BORN ROMANTIC cuts a slice of life out of London life that includes a myriad of characters all of whom border on pathological types.  And it is this very aspect which makes this tasty little film so addictive.  The homing center for these disparate people is a Salsa Club and whether they are committed to the dance routine or not, they weave in and out of each others lives with the salsa music as the glue.  One woman is a grave decorator with anatomical phobias in abundance, another is a bisexual who fears relationships, another is leaping toward the bed the moment she meets a new male.  The men are equally edgy, from a Scotsman who pines for a truly classy woman, to a ATM robber, to a wonderfully warm taxi driver who serves as a paterfamilias and has the only clear view in the bunch. How they all eventually find each other is the point of hte journey. The acting is excellent, the timing first rate, and if you have any difficulty with the various accents of the Londoners, just turn on the English subtitles and you won't miss a thing.  A lovely film full of surprises

You know, I normally have no use for romantic comedies--let alone romantic comedies that revolve around quasi-obscure cultural traditions--but this was--I must admit--quite good.  This is largely due to the fact that its creators saw fit to insert some actual *comedy,* rather than just the cutesiness which typically passes for humor in these affairs, in spite of not being at all funny.  The fact that the characters are, by and large, well-drawn helps too, and including the cab driver (the only one in London, apparently) as a central, unifying figure was a good idea that worked.  I cannot help but compare Born Romantic to Sidewalks of New York, a film I hated (two stars was a bit generous, methinks).  That film was also an ensemble piece examining multiple relationships, but it got bogged down in its self-satisfied smugness, never allowing the charaters to actually be people.  This, on the other hand, does; it has a relatively unaffected charm that made it a highly enjoyable experience (of course, it also didn't hurt that it appealed to my inner anglophile either).  Recommended

i just rented this movie without hearing anything about it. i am a lover of foreign flicks to begin with especially anything the bbc films produce. this film combines humor, romance and the energetic salsa music together perfectly. i was intrigued by all of the various characters and felt that they all blended together in perfect harmony. i can't wait to find the soundtrack and keep it for my collection. a great surprise and heartwarming film about romance and love and its many ways

I first watched this movie because cinamatic legand Joan Crawford was one of the stars in it. Joan plays Amanda Farrow, a rather bossy publishing executive. However, her part is small and the movie has little to do with her character. It's a fine picture, though.

At first glance, "The Best of Everything" looks like "9 to 5" meets "The Devil Wears Prada." But after the first twenty minutes I was convinced that this was a much more complicated tale about relationships taking place in the Big Apple. 

The main plot focused on three clerical workers at the same publishing firm, played by Hope Lange, Diane Baker, and Suzy Parker. Each women has their own trials and tribulations. But I think the one thing that they all have in common is that the men in their lives are all cads. I would say that just about all the men in this film are rather unsympathetic and uncaring. Is this how men really were in the 1950's? I hope not.

Normally I'd reserve two maybe three stars for a picture like this. But since it's Joan's "last great picture" (not counting "Baby Jane," of course) it deserves four

An entertaining soap opera, THE BEST OF EVERYTHING succeeds especially because of its brilliant capturing of 1959.  The attitude, the fashion, the lifestyle, the vernacular and (both ennervating and bittersweet) the culture.  

Once you've enjoyed the movie itself, sit back and relish the great commentary track with both the original novel's author and an amusing film historian.  You'll get quite a few chuckles along with fascinating facts about everything pertaining to the film and the times and circumstances around which it was made.

Wonderful to see so many great stars in all their colorful glory!  Also included, a trailer and newsreel.  Beautiful trasnfer.  A first rate DVD experience

This 1959 soapy saga does indeed have everything: lecherous old geezers making passes at sweet young things, bitter old hags sleeping with married men, bosses who take their frustrations out on underlings, and sex! sex! sex! Rona Jaffe's bestselling book --- think Peyton Place set in Mdhattan --- tells the tale of three young woman who work in the publishing world of NYC ... modern 9-to-5 gals who dream, dare and damn themselves, while wearing terrific Oscar-nominated clothes that they couldn't afford on a secretary's salary. The cast includes Hope Lange, Suzy Parker, Louis Jordan, Diane baker and Stephen Boyd; who better to add extra star power than Joan Crawford as a chain-smoking, orange-haired senior editor who treats her employees the way her lover treats her --- like dirt. Sometimes the best films are the worse. Thank God

 I really miss the genre loosely called "women's pictures" that combined wonderfully lurid storylines (with laugh-inducing  Hays Code cleaned-up dialog) and major, MAJOR fashion. Unfortunately nowadays the closest we get is the really crude "Sex and the City" whose scripts leave nothing to the imagination and where the "fashion" comes direct from Walmart."The Best of Everything" scores major points for a great looking cast, dynamite clothes,and wonderfully trashy storylines. If this isn't the ultimate popcorn movie, WHAT IS??!!?? Ladies, invite your friends over, rustle up some major munchies, fire up this DVD and have a WHALE of a GOOD TIME!!

I remember those days.  I used to dress up for work, the high heels and stockings and garter belts, before pantyhose.  I like this movie and always try to catch it when it's on TV.  I know I'll catch heck for saying this, but I miss those days.  During the so called "women's lib" days women were very cruel to other woman who wanted to be married and raise a family.  I used to say back to these woman "this is America, we have a choice". Of course I was shouted down so I learned to keep my opinions to myself. Whatever we've gained from "women's lib" (much, much more work, if you ask me and our children are suffering for it)doesn't make up for all we've lost

Joan Crawford "Jon"

There are some wonderful reasons to add the newly released-on-DVD "The Best of Everything" to your film library. For one, it is a glittering and colorful glimpse into New York City circa 1959. Fox certainly has done a commendable job with the DVD--the picture quality and sound are both crystal clear. Cinemascope has rarely been this fun to watch, because now one can see it digitally mastered in widescreen with vivid color photography by Deluxe brought to sparkling life. 

The film is very, very lush. From the beginning, when the screen fills with a sunny view of the Manhattan skyline to the sounds of Johnny Mathis crooning the Oscar-nominated theme song, you know you are in for grand entertainment. All of the performances are fine, with Crawford a standout.

I think it's funny that although Joan Crawford only has five to ten minutes of screen time in "The Best of Everything," her picture is featured very prominently on the back and front covers of the DVD. The casual watcher may never know that the ultimate movie star had a only a supporting role, yet with that tiny role she managed to steal the entire picture and make it her own!  That's star power!

As enjoyable as the film is, it is incredibly flawed. If one was interested in sexist attitudes (concerning men AND women) and how they have changed since the 1950s, there couldn't be a more relevant movie to watch. It is shocking, and sometimes disturbing, how much attitudes have changed. 

For example, at one point during the movie, Catherine (played by lovely Hope Lange) is told by David, one of her romantic interests, that once she has proven to herself she can make it in the publishing world (which, in his view, could be the only reason a woman might have some kind of ambition) she should quit it all, get married, and "love happily ever after." Now there is nothing wrong with wanting to be in love happily ever after, but it certainly represents a double-standard. Who would ever tell a man such a thing?  Could you imagine Hope Lange telling David that a man's ambition is only him trying to prove himself, and that he should cut it out and love happily ever after? (now I can imagine Joan Crawford saying that to Clark Gable, but there weren't any characters with that kind of will or independence in this film). 

So much of the dialogue and morality in the film is dated, and some of it is very disturbing, but there are still some good things about the story. There are some great viewpoints on love, and how casual dating and hookups can hurt people, and my favorite line has to be, "Here's to men, with their clean-shaven faces and their dirty little minds." It's funny to say the least!

Yes, please take me back to 1959, to New York in 1959, or even back to Rio de Janeiro, a couple of years before, where I met Rona Jaffe practically every single night at the then world-famous "Sacha's" nightclub, where Rona was already drafting her novel mentally...
When the film started shooting the exteriors in front of the Seagram's building, one could actually walk-up to lovely Suzy Parker and chat with her about how real was the "new morality" of the liberated New York girls in the executive suites, decades before Sex and the City became the post-mortem of the sexual revolution of the Sixties.
At night we had the many parties thrown by Negulesco and his charming wife, while Stephen Boyd was being charming to my wife, Brazilian actress Mariza Woodward, featured in LIFE Magazine as one of the most beautiful gals in Rio.
Oh, yes, take me back!
And if you were not there then, if you were not even born then, do get this DVD and visit New York 1959 and see how charmingly it all started, despite where it eventually ended

As a young White boy growing up on the Navajo reservation was very wonderful, this movie brought back many wonderful memories.  The Navajo friends I had, all rode mustangs so therefore our weekends were spent riding through the bueatiful high deserts of Northern Arizona.  This movie is a great movie, it has all the emotions a person may feel in the 1880's.  Some what, as I felt when we moved to Northern Arizona in 1960.  The people were wonderful to grow up with.  This movie is a great movie, the only problem I had with the DVD is that to see the Bonus Features you have to have a special computer.  I would have been happy to spend the extra money on the movie, if they could have just put it on the DVD.  I would very much like to see the extra parts that have been left out, unless you have a computer that will read these extra parts.  Other wise I would have given this movie a 5 star rating

This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.  I knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way I was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing.  I was right; I fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it.  Recently, I was offered the chance to watch it again.  I thought, "OK, I didn't see the whole thing, it might have gotten better, so I'll give it another chance." ... Bad mistake.  This little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long.  Hidalgo is the name of the horse.  So what?  That's about as boring as this movie.  So why the 1-star markup? Cause the main character is played by Viggo Mortensen, of Aragorn fame in the smash movie series The Lord of the Rings- and I do like Viggo.  I did not, however, like this movie.  It's kind of fitting it should be set in a desert- cause that's exactly where this movie should be buried, never to bore another wave of audiences again.  If you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap, watch Hidalgo; you'll be out in no time

Hidalgo is based upon a true story, so it's no wonder it's thrilling, truth being stranger than fiction and all.  Although it's highly doubtful that everything in the movie actually happened, Frank Hopkins was indeed a real life cowboy, master horseman and rider and he did participate in the great Bedouin horse race of the Middle East known as the "Ocean of Fire" in the 1890's.

This wonderfully stylized and lovingly crafted film clocks in at over two hours, yet never bores and your interest should never waver.  The international cast is terrific, led by Viggo Mortensen in a low-key, subtle performance which brings depth and a real sense of nobility to the notion of a "cowboy'.  We've seen loads of silver screen gun slingers, bandits and marshals from icons like the swaggering John Wayne to the laconic Clint Eastwood, but with Viggo's Frank Hopkins, we may now be witness to one of the most balanced and interesting portrayals of an authentic cowpoke.  And it's all the more interesting because Frank Hopkins isn't all cowboy - half of him is Native American.  This internal duality and cultural division brings character shadings and a unique sense of perspective to Hopkins.

Balancing the tensions of Native Americans with the US Government of the time, the film explores Frank Hopkin's journey between two worlds - that of a half Native American with loyal ties to his tribe and his jobs as a pony express rider and performer in Wild Bill Hickcock's show, all while having to live in the White Man's world.  When he's invited to participate in the Bedouin Race, Frank soon discovers there's a whole other world out there bound by similar dogmatic traditions, where women must hide their faces behind veils, much like he's chosen to hide his native ancestry to enable him to live an easier life.

Sweeping cinematography beautifully composes authentic locations and the stunt choreography infuses the race and the action set-ups with fun and authenticity.  Viggo must have definitely "lived" horses for the film, irregardless of his prior expertise with them.  He clearly is at the reigns of the horse most of the time and he's totally capable and always convincing.  Hidalgo the horse may qualify for his own sequel or a TV series.  This beautiful animal is more expressive than many human actors and it's just one of the many joys and reasons to give this film a chance.  Apparently lost by audiences in it's initial theatrical release, Hidalgo should be discovered by every movie lover.

Surprisingly `Hidalgo' released in '04 didn't live up to studio expectations in terms of either financial earnings, or audience appeal. Only now, two years after its release is this fantastic action/adventure film finding on DVD the adoring audience it so richly deserves. I was initially confused by this movies unexpected lack of acceptance by the public, however after pondering the complexities of this failure for some time I have come to the following conclusion. It was all Aragorn's fault. Yes, that's correct, it was Aragorn's fault. Here are the reasons why I believe this to be true.

`Hidalgo' was Viggo Mortensen's first film following his co-starring role in the massive and unbelievably successful three film production of `The Lord of the Rings.' His long matted hair, scruffy beard and moustache along with those distant, piercing eyes have been forever imprinted into the collective unconscious of every moviegoer. The shock of seeing Viggo as Frank T. Hopkins, American cowboy in a funny hat and bandana, much shorter cropped hair, clean shaven and riding on a little spotted mustang was simply too much for 'the faithful' to handle. Viggo's fan base simply wasn't ready to give up the image of the King of Middle-Earth yet. Unable to accept the new look, people stayed away from the theaters thus turning Disney's expected big drawing card into a major strategic error. To put it plan and simple, `Hidalgo' came out too soon.

If you're finally willing to move beyond the Aragorn persona and see a fast moving, well acted, beautifully shot film with a inspiring story to tell I invite you to give `Hidalgo' a viewing. Viggo is perfect as the half Indian, half white man who rides the little Pinto that never gives up and Omar Sharif delivers his best performance since `Lawrence of Arabia'. He's alert, witty and absolutely delightful as the sometimes harsh, sometimes whimsical Sheikh Riyadh who likes to sit in his tent and read tales of the American Wild West. It's obvious he really enjoyed playing this part. Also excellent performances by Zuleikha Robinson as Jazira, Adoni Maropis as Sakr and a whole cast of exotic, fascinating characters participating in the torturous 3,000 mile desert horse race across the "Ocean of Fire".

Highly Recommended

The Lord of the Rings movies made superstars out of dozens of actors and actresses.  Many have gone on to star in movies that made lots of money, but without the awards and critical recognition of the LOTR movies.  Not so with Viggo Mortensen.  Right after LOTR he followed with this awesome adventure story by Disney.  Coming out the summer after Pirates of the Caribbean, this was supposed to be Disney's next big live-action, summer adventure hit.  Unfortunately, it flopped at the box office.  Luckily, it has made a comeback on the DVD market, which is where this reviewer saw it.  All in all, it is a great movie, and probably one of the best live-action movies Disney has produced in a long while; judging from its ratings here on amazon and on imdb.com.  

In short, this movie is about Frank Hopkins, half-white, half-native american horserider who is mired in middle-age guilt and self remorse.  Along comes an opportunity for a change in scenery - a trip to the Arabian desert for a race.  Frank takes the challenge with his horse Hidalgo and of they go.  The race across the Arabian desert tests both rider and horse, and introduces them to a cast of characters that only an accomplished movie studio like Disney could have created.  We have the strong-willed girl full of innocence and inner strength, a fierce father and tribe leader who suffers no insults to his honor or intelligence, a backstabbing fellow racer who smiles until the final death, a seductive beauty willing to win at any costs, an arrogant prince with no moral bounds, etc, etc...  It all reminds our protagonist of his days in Montana!  During the course of the race, which Frank and Hidalgo win of course; both of them are tested to the limit.  The movie ends on a triumphal note for both.  The rider redeems his guilt by freeing Hidalgo from human ownership forever, and freeing his consciensce of past betrayals.

The soundtrack is awesome, the cinematography is great, the dialogue is realistic, and for once, a movie set in a foreign land that actually uses actors from that area speaking the language of that area!  My compliments to Disney and the cast and crew of this movie.  I highly recommend it to all audiences from teenagers on up

In this movie that was supposedly inspired by the true story of Frank T. Hopkins, Viggo Mortenson does an excellent job of portraying the character.  Whether there actually was the race as described in the movie and whether Frank T. Hopkins actually existed is irrelevant.  What is important is that the movie is enjoyable and the race is nicely plotted.

Frank T. Hopkins is an accomplished rider.  He has been a dispatch rider for the U.S. Army, a Pony Express rider, and he has been in Buffalo Bill's Wild West show.  Frank appears well on his way to alcoholic oblivion when he is asked to race in the 3000 mile Ocean of Fire, a race that has been held for one thousand years.  After the obligatory refusal (all movies of this type must have the humble hero refuse to be a hero) he travels by sea to the Middle East.

A side note.  The movie begins with the infamous Wounded Knee massacre.  The memory of that horrific even supposedly haunts Frank.  I will discuss these distractions more later in this review.

This movie finally comes into its own when the Ocean of Fire race begins.  Several of the sponsors of the race have their own agendas for winning the race.  Numerous attempts are made to kill Frank during the race.  Of course, Frank manages to survive all these attempts.  He also manages to rescue a kidnapped princess, and to save his horse from spikes, big cats, and bullets, not to mention heat, thirst and hunger.  Nearly every part of the movie that deals with the race is quite good and entertaining.

The title of the movie comes from the mustang named Hidalgo.  Hidalgo has a lot of heart and a lot of character.  Hidalgo was smarter than many of the characters in this movie.  Sales of horses will go up as a result of this movie.

The only issue I had with this movie was the distractions.  I thought the Wounded Knee massacre, while a horrible incident and one worthy of a separate movie, to be a distraction from the race.  Even though Frank later saw his ancestors in a hallucination in the desert, we did not need the massacre to recognize who they were.  I also thought the release of the wild mustangs by Frank could have been handled more succinctly, though I admit that seeing mustangs running across the plains of the Midwest was inspiring.  Throwing in all the details about Jazira, the daughter of Sheikh Riyadh (played by the great Omar Sharif) were further distractions.  The result is a movie that is bloated in places and begins too slowly.

I thought Viggo Mortenson was great as Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings movies.  He does an equally good job as Frank T. Hopkins.  Enjoy the race; enjoy the rescue of the princess; fast forward through the rest.

I have to say that I really enjoyed this film.  It is well done and not to mention beautifully shot. It has become one of my favorite films and is much better than most of the drivel that comes out of Hollywood these days.  Most times films are so overhyped that once you sit down to see them you are most often times disappointed.  This film did not receive that much hype and it does not disappoint.  If you love horses, adventure, beautiful scenery and a film about the spirit of man and his horse, then please do see it.  And lets face it (ladies) Viggo Mortensen is just as beautiful as the scenery around him.  He is a very good actor and an underated one at that.  So sit back, pop some corn and enjoy a good adventure.  And admire one of God's most majestic creations...........the horse. (and viggo mortensen!!

Here's an "epic" movie that reminded me of those that were made in the mid 1960s such as Dr. Zhivago and Lawrence Of Arabia. Interesting to note that Omar Sharif was in this modern-day movie and Dr. Zhivago. Several younger friends that saw this film told me they were very disappointed because, thanks to the previews, they thought it would be an action-packed adventure story such as "The Mummy." Well, it wasn't and it was way too slow for them.

Frankly, I thought the "slow" parts were the best and overall, thought the film had just the right amount of action, instead of overdoing it as the recent Mummy pictures did. Another big plus was the cinematography. This is a beautifully filmed movie, stunning in some parts. Another good point is the language: hardly a swear word.

On the negative side, there was the usual political correctness, a la Dances With Wolves in which viewers are reminded several times of the massacre at Wounded Knee and soldiers are portrayed as the bad guys. The horse race had some credibility problems, too, as "Hidalgo" came back from the dead not once but twice to race like Secretariat! 
Anyway, if you are looking for a modern-day adventure story with old-fashioned storytelling and no language problems, this film is for you and the rest of the family

3 stars for the movie, plus a bonus star to the director for being a genius.  How you ask?  It's all about Paul Walker.  Man do I love that guy.  Absolute worst actor in Hollywood, but still gets part after part.  His acting style is like a piece of wood with constipation.  But he's just bad enough to be lovable.  People still like him despite his failing, not like Hayden Christenson (Anakin from Star Wars), who just needs to die.

Anyways, so the director is sitting and thinking: "Hmmm... Paul Walker's in this movie.  How do I distract people from his god awful acting enough so they'll still like it?"  Then the answer hits him like a sledge hammer to the head.  Get a super ridiculously hot woman to play along side him!  Enter Jessica Alba.  In a bikini.  Think any guy is watching Paul Walker any more?  And that handles half the audience at least.

Now if that isn't enough, we also have pirates, sharks, mantas, and other sea creatures who consequently get addicted to cocaine, and lots of underwater shots of our illustrious stars diving for treasure / drugs.  Also, putting Paul Walker underwater for much of the film erases the need for him to talk.  Bonus

Into The Blue turned out to be a decent movie. I was not expecting a story or ANYTHING from this movie other than pure eye candy. I was surprised by a decent story with suspense and action and some really beautiful cinematography. The underwater shots are really breathtaking. I also enjoyed the special features on the DVD which demonstrated how these great shots were taken in waters that were both beautiful and shark infested.
Of course, aside from the beautiful underwater photography, there are the movies stars who are some of the most beautiful people in the world. Jessica Alba looks incredible. Ashley Scott is also gorgeous. And for the ladies, there's Paul Walker and Tyson Beckford.
I wasn't expecting much from this film, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's not going to win any Academy Awards, but it is entertaining and fun

If you like to be entertained this film is worth renting and if you are a big fan, like I am, of Jessica Alba this film is worth buying.  I didn't see this film at the theater, but after renting it, I immeadiately bought it.  You can read the other reviews here from the psuedo-critics who pan the film, but the bottom line here is:  Was the film entertaining?  The answer to that question is yes!  The reason why most of us go see a film in the first place is to be entertained, and this film delivers!  If you are someone who likes to have fun and likes to be entertained I guarantee you will enjoy this film

Jared (Paul Walker) and Sam (Jessica Alba) are a pair of salvagers living a poor but mostly happy existence on the shores of the Bahamas waiting for that day when they'll finally find the sunken treasure ship that will solve all their problems. When Jared's old friend Bryce (Scott Caan) arrives on the island to relax it looks like their dreams will come true when they find the wreckage of the pirate ship Zephyr. Unfortunately, the Zephyr is resting next to the a crashed drug plane carrying 800 kilos of cocaine... cocaine its owner (James Frain) wants back.

Into The Blue has Great Acting, Good Directing, Great Special Effects, and Good Writing. Let me start off with saying I definitely prefer Paul Walker not driving fast cars and this film just proves I'm right. The Acting in this film has got to be its strongest point Jessica Alba does another great job in her third movie of 2005 and Paul Walker does a great job as well. Scoot Cann also has a standout performance as the standalone jerk! The Special Effects were probably the second best aspect because since basically all of it was underwater they did a very exceptional job like with the explosions and stuff. The Writing and Directing were also very good but I believe the Acting stood out the most.

Overall if you like Jessica Alba or Paul Walker or Underwater Adventures You'll love this movi

I actually took the kids to see this movie and it was entertaining for the whole family.  It had everything for all ages.  Family friendly with a lesson for everyone.  Being a weekend parent I have to utilise the time with my grommits.  Because in a few years they will be turning into their terrible teens. Thats the years they start thinking they know everything. And hanging out with their old man won't be cool anymore.  Adam's movies are so family friendly that my kids always enjoy the night outs

I am a person who mostly avoids mainstream movies due to violence &amp; Hollywood messages that don't match up with my values.  With that said, I'd have to say this movie was definitely worthwhile.  My husband convinced me to take a look &amp; I wasn't disappointed.

I won't repeat what others have said, but Click forces you to think about your own choices in life.  The simple message is this--appreciate people, not things.  Maybe that topic makes a lot of folks uncomfortable?  Not sure why else people wouldn't like the movie.

I say if you want a movie with a positive message &amp; don't mind examining your own heart in the process, check it out

The movie is a about a guy, who does a lot of work and no fun and then feels sorry about that. That's pretty much the whole story. Well, the idea is quite powerful but not new, the characters are done in the "comics" style and very primitive, the jokes are quite boring. 

Actually what is really amazing, that it could've been ok to watch as a family movie, but a few really tasteless jokes made it PG13 rated without adding any fun, so the movie about family values is not appropriate for kids.

Too boring for adults, not appropriate for kids, too much moral for young crowd - I can't really think who might like it

In "Click," Adam Sandler stars as Michael Newman, an overworked, underappreciated architect who's let his job replace his family.  Fed up with not receiving his fair share at work and knowing that he's about to lose his family, Newman snaps, decides that his family needs a universal remote just like everybody else and hurries out of his house and into the only store that's open that evening, Bed, Bath, and Beyond.  What he finds in the Beyond (Way Beyond) section of the store is Morty (Christopher Walken), a sales clerk who gives him a universal remote that's a tad bit unusual.  It controls every facet of his life.  He can skip over watching his dog violate a stuffed duck, mute his wife during arguments, and basically bypass any of the ho-hum moments of his life in order to get to the good stuff.  Unfortunately, skipping over so much of his life means that Newman misses the small things that make life worth living, and the big things that make life either grand or miserable.

In short, this flick is a play on the Christmas classic, "It's A Wonderful Life," with the typical Sandler spin.  However, unlike many reviewers have stated, I don't think that the toilet humor that Sandler's accused of using in most of his past films is too distracting in this one.  The first half of the film is rather humorous, thanks to a wonderful supporting cast which includes Henry Winkler, Julie Kavner, Sean Astin, and the breathtaking Kate Beckinsale.  David Hasselhoff and Jennifer Coolidge also throw in some funny performances.

It's the second half of the film that really makes "Click" click.  As Sandler's character ages, he begins to realize that he's not that great of a guy.  He also comes to find out that there are things in life that seem rather dull until you lose them.  

Overall, this is a decent flick.  It's more deserving of three and a half stars than four, but I'll round up based on the second half of the film.  It does drag at times, but it's all worth it.

Recommended as a strong rental for casual Sandler fans and a definite purchase for those who love all things Sandler

Don't watch Click if you're in the mood for a light-hearted comedy.  The middle of the film is miserable.  Of course, it has a Hollywood happy ending.  The comedy bits are OK but few and far between.  If Click had been marketed as a drama, this would be less of a problem. 

The story line has some great life lessons.  Without giving away too much, the morals of this movie are: 1.  put family first; 2. don't wish your life away, but enjoy every minute of it, even the mundane.  For driving home those lessons, Click has some value.  It is also great to see Adam Sandler do well in a dramatic role.  He has more range than you might imagine.  

But there's something very unsatisfying about watching Click that's not fixed by the sugar-coated ending or the few bits of Sandler-esque pranks and smartass jokes. In short, it's a mediocre film

It probably won't take the smartest person to realize that my review of a Adam Sandler movie won't be the most unbiased review out there considering my nickname. But much like his other past dumb comedies, Click made into my DVD library. But unlike his previous movies, Sandler doesn't play the lovable loser. Instead he is a fairly successful architect who close to making partner and he already has the girl in the form of Kate Beckinsale (Serendipity) who seems to like to walk around in pajama short shorts and tight fitting shirt.

Okay, so not everything is perfect as he is having trouble balancing his family and doing enough at work to be made partner. The pressure culminates when he has to do research on Asian architecture so he can land a prestigious Japanese client only to turn on a remote control car while trying to play a video on the subject. So it's time to a universal remote so he doesn't open his garage door every time he tries to turn on the television. But the only place that is open at the time is Bed, Bath, and Beyond where Sandler has to venture into the Beyond where he runs into the last person you want to meet at the end of a dark hallway, Mr. Cowbell himself, Christopher Walken.

As anyone who saw the trailer can figure up, the remote that Walken gives Sandler is truly a universal remote as it gives Sandler the power to control his whole universe. He can fast forward threw fights with his wife, mute annoying people, and pause to kick someone in the crotch without them knowing (hey it's an Adam Sandler movie; you need your prerequisite object to the crotch). No remote control gag goes unused. Well except for close captioning. But anyways. Unfortunately for Sandler the remote comes with Tivo so it starts predicting his habits and starts to fast forwards even when he doesn't want to do so. And unfortunately for us as Sandler goes further in the future, the sappier the movie gets and almost plays out like A Christmas Carol with Walken playing all three ghosts.

But luckily there are plenty of fart jokes and other sophomoric gags that you would expect from a Sandler movie that keeps the sappy parts from being unwatchable. Plus Sandler brings in some of his past coworker who knock the comedy out of the park including The Fonz (The Waterboy), Sean Austin (50 First Dates), Terry Crews (The Longest Yard), and of course Rob Schneider who seems to pop up in every of his movie, but you will have to look in the deleted scenes to hear his catchphrase, "You can do it!" The best cameo though goes to James Earl Jones who you will just have to see the movie to see how he is used. But when it comes down to it, if you love Sandler, you will love this movie, but if you're not, you are complete and total tool and need to get a sense of humor

I had heard that this film was "really funny" and "worth watching".  I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan but I am a fan of Kate Beckinsale and Christopher Walken.  I was sorely disappointed with this film.  The audience can't relate to the main character at first because he is just down right irritating.  I was hoping that the gags would get funnier but they didn't.  I also found most of the film rather depressing as we watch the main characters life being slowly destroyed around him.  Overall Click was ok, Kate Beckinsale looked beautiful as usual but even that was not enough to save it.  I would NOT recommend buying this film.

Everyone is expecting the Happy Gilmore/Billy Madison Adam Sandler of ten years ago.  Adam has grown up.  The movie actually HAS a great plot, and has some laugh out loud moments.  Are you going to be rolling on the floor by the time the movie is over?  No.  But are you going to get caught up in the story of the movie, and put yourself in his shoes as the plot moves on?  Absolutely.  It's one of his best movies, and a can't miss

Total Score----------19 out of 50, Grade D+

Violence-------------Low, mostly comical, nothing nasty

Language-------------Medium High, one F'bomb, lots more of the rest
Overall--------------Teens will love it, specially the younger ones

      I have enjoyed many a Adam Sandler movie, Happy Gilmore is still one of the funniest movies ever, and The Waterboy will always be one of my favorite comedies as well, but he sure missed here. If not for the amazing, sensational and hilarious Christopher Walken, this would have been a total bomb. The jokes he makes at Sandler's expense are right-on and it's a shame he wasn't in the movie ALOT more. Sandler over-acts big time, and when he tries to get you to cry for him, well, I'd just about had enough by then. Granted, you will laugh a few times, this is Adam Sandler, and for the most part, the man is a comic genius, I'd just wish he would have made either a comedy or a drama, not both.

But what really, and I mean REALLY dragged this movie down was the complete and total waste of one Kate Beckinsale. This is one of the hottest, sexiest, fiery women in film today, and she looked absolutely lost in this. If Selene see's this, she is gonna kick Kate square in the booty for wasting her time with this. Drew Berrymore would have been perfect for the role, and who knows, might have improved it even................a littl

As the head honcho of [...] I have watched well over 200 reality/political films and give "Why We Fight" my highest recommendation. This needs to be shown on prime time television;  if it was it would prompt a thunderous public outcry for badly needed government &amp; military reforms.

It covers facts that many don't know about the United States, like our penchant for endless involvement in military actions over seas. The film's launching pad is the infamous Eisenhower farewell speech in which he warns America of the growing military industrial complex. Then, in a unique and compelling style it pinpoints famous people, places and moments in time with candid footage and revealing quotes; it also delves into the personal perspectives of a few ordinary citizens affected by Sept. 11 and the resulting occupation of Iraq.  

It visits key players in government and exposes what really drives the war machine. It looks at military contractors and Congress and their incestuous relationship. It also reveals the much too influential role the so called Think Tanks play in crafting our national policy. In addition the soundtrack features some great musical talent.

The information presented in this film is something every American should know, but they don't know it for the most part because the people who want those war wheels turning don't want the people to know what they're doing or why. It seems the war minded even believe the people do not have any need to know.  The people beg to differ. "Why We Fight" is on my personal Top Ten Most Important Movies list which is why it would be a great gift.  Informing people is the kind of gift really worth giving.

1. It's extremely elementary.  You could read for 10 minutes on Wikipedia, Source Watch, or a Seymour Hersh article and get more substantive information.

2.  It's manipulative.  The music in particular is far too emotionally leading in a contrived and obvious way.  This film does not try to be subtle, like the Thin Blue Line.

3.  It's incredibly patronizing towards members of the military and those interested in military technologies or tactics, insinuating they are all white, red-necked, country music-listening, rodeo-watching sheeple.  It is certainly true that many of those we get geeky about are not the Incredibles we make them out to be.  Hell, I've met fighter pilots and delta force who sounded like red-necked, brainwashed morons, without an original idea in their entire heads, but the film went a bit far with this theme.

4.  I had the sense the interviews and sources it is relying on are fairly limited.  You see pretty much the same few people over and over again for the entire length of the film.  This doesn't give the impression of a wide variety of parallel same-conclusions.

5.  This documentary was oddly simplistic in a number of ways and left out many key pieces of information.  Its density was lite, considering it is a full length film.  This is not an extra-long episode of Frontline.  Why wasn't Brazil on the map of covert ops to overthrow democratic governments for corporate purposes?  Why did they show the first Gulf War as justifiable and honest?  There was at least as much distortion, propaganda, spinning, and out and out psychological warfare PR going on against the American people during Gulf War 1 to show another very clear trend, and "Why We Fight" was interested in trends.

It was still quite good, and it's a nice source of on-the-record vomit by neo-cons like Perle and provocateurs like Kristol, both who are currently trying to pretend themselves back into the mainstream by now opposing the policies they pushed so hard for in the first place.  I also think the circular referencing back onto the characters, such as the bomb-designer, was well done and moving.

So in conclusion, I'm glad I watched it and "Why We Fight" is an excellent primer for those who have no idea what is going on.  But it is not a truly great documentary.

I can't recall ever seeing a more thoughtful documentary on the most recent of our nation's military efforts.  What separates the American experience from that of almost every other "empire" throughout history is the fact that critics of our government are allowed to voice their opposing views.  Efforts by some to paint a message like this as anti-American are disengenuous and downright wrong.

Beginning with Dwight Eisenhower's farewell address that warned of the danger posed by a military-industrial complex, the filmmakers build an intriguing case of both pros and cons associated with much of American military efforts over the past 50 years.  Yes, it has a largely critical view of the quagmire that is the Iraq War, but that's hardly unique these days.

Two participants stand out in my mind.  One is the retired New York policeman whose response to his son's death in the World Trade Center attack was to request that a bomb be labeled with the name of his son.  As time elapsed and information came to light, his view regarding the war changed dramatically.  Does he approve of the war now?  No!  Does he regret his effort to memorialize his son?  Still no, although he qualifies that with the notation that he was operating with the information available at that time.  Would he do that again?  I doubt it.

The other noteworthy player in this ensemble is Senator John McCain, who may very well use his participation in this work to woo political moderates should he make a run for the White House in 2008.  His expression of his ideas and reactions underscore his basic decency and indepence from the current administration (in marked contrast to some of his more recent efforts to pander to the fundamentalist right wing of the Republican Party).

This is an excellent documentary, one that I suspect will easily withstand the test of time and be just as interesting from 10 to 20 years from now

The film Why We Fight, I believe is nothing more than another movie that looks to criticize America. I felt that the movie, only told one side of the argument, and that side was clearly not pro-America. The film portrays the United States as a power hungry nation, which is looking to create an empire and extend its influence around the world. The film constantly criticizes the decisions of America leaders to engage into foreign combat. The film however, does not present an alternative solution. It fails to take into consideration that America may be acting out of self defense. The film constantly criticizes America for engaging in combat throughout the world. What I have to say to the director of this film is: Is it not alright to defend your nation, after terrorist drive planes into two buildings, killing 3,000 people? Is it not alright to defend your nation against religious zealots, who are looking to destroy your way of life? Is it wrong to attempt to bring freedom and peace to the Middle East, by toppling a murderous dictator? When I see these questions, I have to answer no to all of them. I feel that if America feels threatened, it should not have to seek permission to defend itself. President Bush put it properly I feel when he stated "After the chaos and carnage of September 11th, it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal papers," and "America will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our people." This film can criticize America and label it as a bully nation, but these terrorist must be brought to justice. President Eisenhower once said, "Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin." As the most powerful nation in the world, it is our duty to spread freedom throughout the world. It is our duty to allow the people of other countries the privilege of enjoying the same rights that we as Americans, sometimes take for granted. Since when, has it become wrong to defend your nation. Why must America be criticized for engaging in conflict, when it feels threatened? Is it not the job of the President of the United States to defend the 300 million people he was elected to represent? Does anybody think for a second that these people would hesitate to attack America again, if they are given the chance? We can never let our guard down. Freedom does not come free. On September 11, 2001 we saw firsthand how evil, those who want to destroy us can be. You can not negotiate with these types of people. The only way to solve this problem and protect ourselves is to act decisively with force. On the morning of the September 11, 2001 attacks, President Bush stated that "Freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward, and freedom will be defended." Indeed freedom was and is being defended, and I see nothing wrong with that. Words are not enough to protect our nation. President Theodore Roosevelt said, "Great thoughts speak only to the thoughtful mind, but great actions speak to all mankind," and our great action, will be to defend this great nation. In the words of President Hoover, "Freedom is the open window through which pours the sunlight of the human spirit and human dignity," and it is America's job to ensure that the people of the world have the opportunity to live in freedom. Remember: "Words without actions are the assassins of idealism." Herbert Hoove

This documentary is absolutely bone-chilling, really providing a powerful and honest look into how war has been waged in the modern era, demonstrating how the American public has been lied to and given propaganda in modern wars, as opposed to just giving them unbiased and truthful information and coverage, and giving the viewer an idea of how war has become more and more about imperialism and neo-Colonialism over time.  It was also fascinating to note that the original words in President Eisenhower's great Farewell Address were actually "the military-industrial-congressional complex," but that he changed it so that he wouldn't alienate Congress, whom he'd gotten along pretty well with during his two terms.  It's also a surprise to hear such a stinging indictment of military buildup and such a strong warning to exercise military power justly coming from someone who was a 5-star general, a career officer, and a Republican to boot.  Sadly, we haven't heeded his wise parting words to us, the same way we haven't paid heed to President Washington's Farewell Address, in which he similarly warned us against getting involved in foreign entanglements and in not abusing our military strength or the nation's great ability to do good instead of evil.  I've always thought Eisenhower was a lousy president (though a great general), one of my all-time least-favorite presidents, but my opinion of him was raised a bit after hearing his Farewell Address and finding out his feelings about the dangerous road the military and warfare were taking after WWII, as well as how he was against the dropping of the A-bomb on Japan.

However, this film can seem a bit uneven, as compelling and indisputable as the evidence it presents is.  Though it claims to trace the evolution of modern warfare and the bloated military buildup since WWII (it's shocking how much the U.S. spends for defence in comparison with all other NATO nations and even enemies like China and Iran), and how the government and media have successfully used propaganda to manipulate public opinion to be pro-war and to not question or protest these actions, a lot of the focus seems to be on the current Iraq war, with some time given over to Vietnam as well.  An awful lot of conflicts were glossed over or not even delved into, such as Korea, Bosnia, Kosova, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Laos, Columbia, Guatemala, and Chile.  The historical perspective and the film's theme and conclusion would have been even stronger and more compelling had there been equal focus on these other conflicts instead of just brushing them aside in favor of the two that most people already have heard a lot about.

Extras include an audio commentary by Col. Lawrence Wilkerson and director Eugene Jarecki, a trailer, previews for other documentaries put out by the same company, extra scenes, television appearances made by Mr. Jarecki, question and answer sessions he held with various groups he spoke to, and extended featurettes telling us more about some of the characters we met.

This film can hardly be accused of being anti-military, since many of the people interviewed have either served or are currently serving in the military.  I'm a strong pacifist and conscientious objector myself, and I'm not anti-military either.  Like the people interviewed, I agree that we need a strong and prepared military for those times when conflict is inevitable, and there are wars which I absolutely feel to have been morally justified, such as WWII and the Civil War, wars it would have been immoral to have not fought.  And the military should stay all-volunteer, and be equal opportunity, so that people from the poor and working-class (many of them minorities) won't be so hugely represented in favor of white people from higher socioeconomic brackets, people who have historically been able to get out of serving because of their family's money and connections.  The young people like William Solomon who voluntarily go in should know ahead of time what they're getting into, and if they're deployed, know just what they're supposed to be fighting for, instead of being misled and outright lied to by the government.  This documentary, in spite of its unevenness, should be required viewing for every concerned citizen out there; maybe then we'll see some change in the military-industrial-congressional complex

Empire building carries a cost.   What will it cost America in the end?   It has been noted that there seems to be a pattern where the very recognizition that an empire exists is the beginning of its collapse.   May we recognize it for what it is before we have too far to fall.   Once again we are haunted by the better angels of our past - men who warned us about the cost of not being vigilant.  Too long we have been asleep.  At last there is a wakeup call, may we not ignore it

I covered a similar theme in my international relations MA - whilst any programme made for TV has to be reasonable breif on the subject, I found this to be a very well argued and produced programme.

I recomend it, not so much as some dark conspiracy, but more a genuine question about large private interest with huge influence in a democratic country. We should question to make sure that what happens in our name, is always in our interest

I'm giving "Why We Fight" 4 stars for its uniqueness and having good intentions, but could have given it a 3 for being somewhat 'dumbed down' and uneven in content. Hours (or days) could be spent analyzing what the film could have been compared to what it is.

For starters, WWF spends most of its time concentrating on the current Iraq War and the lies used to sell that war to the US public. It makes a half hearted attempt to give some background of America's tragic history in the Arab world, but never once mentions US long term funding, diplomatic support and the military arming of Israel with US weaponry. Meanwhile, perhaps 20 mins or more is spent listening to a NY father of a son killed on 9/11 explain how he was taken in by the Bush administration's nonsense regarding WMD's and Sadam's fictitious Al-Qaeda connections. This is followed by his later surprise and outrage when he finds that the obviously false pretense is indeed false. The movie doesn't really have the courage to delve into the most contentious (and dangerous) aspects of Why We Fight, but eats up time on a personal story that, while somewhat compelling, is mainly irrelevant. This is what I mean by the 'dumbing down' aspect of the documentary.

Another area WWF gets sloppy with is the seeming lumping together of various US actions into one WWF bucket. Bosnia and Kosovo are tossed into the bucket (as red warzone spots on the map) along with everything else, as if all US military actions are the product of rightwing think tanks. And nothing is said regarding US inaction (Rwanda) or the picking and choosing of where/when to let loose with 'Shock &amp; Awe'.

The level of cold war overreaction (sheer numbers of unconventional US stockpiles) would have helped make the point of the money making business interests in the arms industry, but is never really mentioned.

Some of the special features (especially "Ike's Evolution") are more interesting than the edited film in that they give a fuller historical background of how we got here and how a relatively few misguided zealots could find themselves with the military means to actually do the unthinkable... invade Iraq.

Since there is so precious little that even attempts to inspect our state of affairs, WWF is worth viewing. But it is nowhere close to the level of documentary skill that a typical PBS Frontline episode has.

A very good movie, Kiss the Girls, sheds light on a series of disappearances of young girls in North Carolina.
There are slight hints of Seven, The Bone Collector, Resurrection, and The Silence of the Lambs so the movie falls into the action/adventure/mystery/thriller/horror type of category, though it is way far removed from that level of gore and horror.
Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd (who is GORGEOUS!), and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well!
Overall, though not a masterpiece it is definitely a movie worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.

This is a great thriller - simply that - and I was really surprised by it. I don't know why I spurned it when it was out in theatres - maybe because Rosie O'Donnell gave away who the killer was on one of her interviews, and I love her, but WHY give away the big surprise of Whodunit? If I hadn't known who the killer was, I would've been floored during the final act - as it was, it was suspensefully done.

Many folks have covered the ligistics of the tale in their reviews, so I won't rehash it here. I'll just say I was really impressed with the acting and the camera work (so cool)! Everyone gives an excellent performance and the pacing of the film is well done. Lots of heart-pounding action! My only beef was with the very ending - I would've liked a little more of a resolution, so I'll probably check out the book to see how James Patterson wraps things up. Good film all in all. Suspenseful

I recently saw an excellent romantic comedy: Kiss the Girls (1997), starring Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd.  Freeman stars as Alex Cross, a talented boxing coach who falls breathlessly in love with young physician Kate McTiernan (beautifully played by Ms. Judd).  Both Alex and Kate are recovering from messy divorces when they first meet at the Caf Nocturnal, a cozy little dive on the West side of Los Angeles.  After a great deal of verbal sparring, they begin to date-and things get hot and heavy real quick!  There is an adorable scene in which Freeman and Judd shovel dollops of vanilla and chocolate ice cream into each other's mouths, proving that racial and generational differences are relative and unimportant.  The film is about love's magical ability to cross boundaries and contains oodles of on-screen chemistry between Freeman and Judd, notably when the latter gives the former a half-naked back massage.  Not to be missed!

Hot babes kidnapped,... blah blah blah.  This is a spellbinding suspenseful thriller with more than one twist so have an extra bag of popcorn ready for the microwave because your eyes will be glued to the screen.  This movie is all about the viewer trying to keep up as the detective negotiates the maze of clues and distractions.

MORGAN FREEMAN is the reason I watched this movie.  Loved it!  Every time there's an "Alex Cross" novel-movie available I watch it.  Driving Miss Daisy, Seven, High Crimes, Shawshank Redemption, Glory, Million Dollar Baby, and all those many other movies are excellent, still, Morgan Freeman as the outright leading character are the height of entertainment!

Just get all the "Alex Cross Detective" movies starring Morgan Freeman available and watch them four or five times.  The movies share titles with novels, but don't let that delay your viewing.

An avid reader, I had never heard of James Patterson until I had seen "Kiss The Girls" and "Along Came A Spider".  Thus, I had the benefit of not being concerned as to whether the movie script followed the novel to the letter.  Who cares?!  If they differ, it is most likely because, duh, one is a MOVIE while the other is a BOOK.  Reviewers who complain about the differences must not understand that what makes a good chocolate cake doesn't quite make a good chocolate ice cream.  To achieve the same flavor, you've got to change some key ingredients.

Morgan Freemam MADE the character Alex Cross worth watching.  When you need an actor to literally CARRY a movie, you've got to get someone with a reputation for doing the heavy lifting.  Freeman has long since done that in "Driving Miss Daisy".  Recently, though I don't know why he bothered to do it, unless as a personal favor to his friend Clint Eastwood, Freeman did all the hard work again in "Million Dollar Baby".  Come on folks.  I like Eastwood as much as anyone, but there's a REASON he's been directing movies and not acting in them for decades now, and "MDB" is a painful example.  Hilary Swank?  Well, if you get "packaged" between Eastwood's direction and Freeman's acting, cleary people will mistake you for an actress!  At least partially reminds me of Driving Miss Daisy.

When you search "DVDs" for "Morgan Freeman", it lists 'related searches' as "Denzel Washington", "Mel Gibson", and "Tom Hanks".  Those guys are listed as RELATED to Morgan Freeman!  You should really see this movie.  And also see "ALONG CAME A SPIDER", which I've also reviewed

On the lines of Wag the Dog, but nowhere near as powerfully satiric/dark, is 15 Minutes. The basic undercurrent of the movie is the theme of media, its influence on people and the kind of perceptions &amp; distortions that it can create. Somewhere, at least in the screenplay, there is a bit of lampooning of the USofA, not just the way the media controls people, but also in the aspect of the legal systems - the double jeopardy law &amp; the "unable to stand trial" on grounds of insanity and stuff. Having said that, the movie does provide a sharp look into media &amp; its effects in one dimension. 
In the backdrop of this scenario comes yet another strong performance by De Niro &amp; Burns. The characters are well fleshed out and played quite well by their cast. The liberal smattering of Czech &amp; Russian influences gives the movie an interesting twist. And therein is threaded the plot, two guys coming to the US as tourists and trying to make it rich quick by beating the system. There are elements of the movie which are cliched &amp; trite, which tend to take away from a serious theme, but in the interest of 'masala' viewability, I guess these foibles can be passed over and the movie enjoyed well.
15 minutes - definitely worth a watch, slightly violent though

this is more realistic then some may admit. you see it all the time in the stories on tv, reality is twisted to the point where no one knows what the truth really is, best example is michael jackson. everyone has their opinions and the media is a great tool to use if you have the power to get it on your side. that is what this movie is all about.

the movie depicts the evil intentions of 2 immigrants trying to become movie stars by filming their brutal murders. the plot was pretty original. i don't think i have seen any other movie doing this although i may be wrong. it was interesting how they were using the hand held camera video for a lot of the scenes to help with the realism. you can see behind what was being shown on the video he was shooting.

there was quite a bit of satire and irony in this movie. almost to the point of overwhelming, but overall i recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good cop movie. i would say that this is somewhat similar to the movie paparazzi. storylines are a bit different, but both show how the media changes things around to make the better story.

The ideas behind 15 minutes aren't bad at all. Take one Robert DeNiro, put him in New York, mix him with some American-dream hunting Eastern Europeans on a killing spree, and try to provoke some emotions, and have a sly dig at the American justice system. Lets see...nothing happened...only repulse.

If, like everyone else, you plan on watching this film because DeNiro is in it, you will be dissapointed. He puts in a tired performance, almost as if he knows the film is a load of B.S. The attempt to be hard-hitting goes horribly wrong, instead it's just repulsive over the top violence, and its pointless...naked prostitute gets hacked to pieces, why? There are ways to create provoking films with such violence but they have to have meaning, such as 8mm (the horrible subject of snuff movies, hard-hitting meaningfull film), 15 minutes is far from meaningfull. We all know there are some deranged psychopaths out there doing just that, but when converting it to a film, it needs a deeper meaning, otherwise it turns into melodramatic Hollywood [...].

If you like brain-dead gore and violence, lack of plot and cringing melodrama. Go ahead

15 Minutes is a horrifying and gritty peek into the injustice of the American legal system and also the news media.  Wow, two digs in one film, how can you resist?

Emil Slovak, a Czech National (played by Karel Rodan), and his friend Oleg Razgul, a Russian National (played by Oleg Taktarov), who met in Prague, decide to travel to America, the land of opportunity.  Emil wants to hunt down his old crime partner, who took all the money from the robbery he was jailed for, but Oleg is infatuated with American Cinema and wants be a filmmaker.

Immediately upon arriving, Oleg steals a video camera from a store and they are off to confront Emil's old partner and get their money back.  But while Oleg films the event, Emil discovers that his portion of the money was already spent, and he kills his friend and friend's wife.  Unfortunately, there was someone else watching the murder.  Daphne Handlova had been staying with her friends, and fled the apartment after witnessing the murders.  An illegal alien herself, she does not want for the police or the killers to find her, but leaves her purse behind in the apartment where Emil discovers who she is.

The apartment is burned to cover the bodies, "A Bohemian Barbeque" says Oleg, which calls in not only successful homicide detective Eddie Flemming (Robert De Niro), but Fire Marshal Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns) to the scene.

Emil and Oleg get away, but while Emil obsesses with finding Daphne, Oleg obsesses about filming their "Trip to America", killings and all.  He believes he is making the greatest movie ever.  They begin to watch New York's hot and exploitive news show called "Top Story", anchored by shady newsman/reporter Robert Hawkins (played expertly by Kelsey Grammer).

These three men, Flemming, Warsaw, and Hawkins, become irresistible targets to Emil and Oleg, the two Eastern-European psychopaths believing that controlling and taunting these famous men will give them the recognition they desire.

I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but suffice to say that there is a brutal murder scene where Flemming showcases just how tough a cop he is, and Hawkins will reveal himself as slimiest snake in the media industry, and Emil will learn enough to know that insanity can set him free even if he is caught.

There is action from beginning to end in this movie, a tight and somewhat confusing plot at times, some great acting from both the stars and the supporting cast (including a great character played by David Alan Grier).  There is seediness and wretchedness and hopelessness, and an ending that makes the film come together quite nicely.  If you are ready for a little brutal cop action in your life, give 15 Minutes a try.  Enjoy!

15 Minutes is worth the money.  It probably will not be the number one DVD in your collection, but you're sure to go back and watch it from time to time.  This film gives an interesting, if not frightening, look at the role mass-media play in our country's daily life.  We don't think about it, since we are living it... but this film gives us a view of someone who might not be used to the faced paced, 24-hour news cycle lifestyle that most of us live today.  
At the center of the movie's plot is a greedy, slick breaking-news style anchor who is given the 'gift' of being the only personality in town to have the near-realtime footage of a string of murders, as they are being committed.  He has a moral pause, only for a second, before he unabashedly trumpets the news to the entire world.  The rest of the movie deals with the minds of the killers and the techniques used by the authorites to catch them.  All in all.. not the best movie out there.. but worth the money.

"The Mothman Prophecies" is one of the most underrated contemporary horror films I've ever seen.  I only saw this once and that was awhile ago, but I do remember being amazed that a movie this good could be swept under the rug as it seemingly has been.

Richard Gere (yeah, I know) plays a Washington Post reporter named John Klein who loses his wife in a very curious car accident.  After the accident which is purposely filmed so that we don't know how or why it really happened, his terminally damaged wife starts drawing really weird pictures of a moth.  She keeps asking Klein if he saw this bird of sorts or not, a kind of Dracula-like figure with two eyes that are too bright to make one comfortable.  At first he insists he saw nothing but keeps the pictures, the childlike and chilling images playing a perennial part in the film later on.  

Will Patton has to be the best actor in this movie.  He plays Gordon Smallwood, outwardly a small town nut and actually a man being driven insane by the bizarre enigma that this innocuous little town unknowingly houses.  When Klein shows up at Gordon's house (and has a rifle shoved in his face), it is not by accident.  Nothing in this movie really is.  The way Pellington shoots the scenes of Gordon losing his mind is unforgettable--it happens in a fizzy, weird video game type way which comes off very vividly. 

I've never liked Laura Linney too much and have always felt she belongs on TV but she does a decent job as Connie Mills, the local sherrif who basically serves as the dramatic witness for Klein's breakdowns as 
the REAL star of the movie--Indrid Cold--keeps calling him. Only in "The Exorcist" or "Black Christmas", perhaps, have I seen a movie before in which a creepy, otherworldly voice becomes the star.  Even when Klein tries to escape his obsession and tear out the jack from the phone, it keeps ringing and ringing.

This is an exercise in derangement and a strange form of hope.  The climax will strike some as impressive and others as senseless.  Bottom line: every horror fan should see this.

I just read Dirk's "spolier" ending to the Mothman Prophecies and had to say huh?  Demonic, fallen angles? What?  Did we watch the same movie?  If all you go by is the movie, that might be the impression you're left with. But if you've ever looked into the events that happened around Point Pleasant, or any of the books on the subject, you'll see that the Mothman was more UFO related than anything. At same time of the Mothman sightings the Point Pleasant area  was in a wave of UFO reports, Men-In-Black, and all sorts of goings-on up in the sky. In fact, Mothman played only a very small part in the drama, it was by far predominately UFO related, as Keel makes clear.

Unfortunately, the producers chose to abandon this aspect of the story entirely, and so the happenings at Point Pleasant lost their entire frame of reference. If you see this movie thinking this was the way things actually happened, you might come to the conclusion of the Mothman being evil, demonic, fallen angles, whatever you like. But if you research the incident at all, you'll see you're only getting a fraction of the story from the movie. And if, like Dirk, you thereby think you know all about what Mothman actually was based on just the movie alone, then all your conclusions end up being based simply on a Hollywood writer's imagination and script and nothing more. Mothman having anything to do with demons and angels or any religious overtones is as far from the truth as you could possibly be. Don't judge by the movie, read the book

I was scared of the dark after watching this last night! The acting, scenery and special effects were all wonderful. From the very beginning, you are drawn into the darkness and paranoia (sp) of Klein's unravelling life. Is the Mothman real or not? Klein's investigation forces him to confront metaphysics, angels, premonitions and other things that crouch in the shadows. OTOH I didnt care for the ending ... too staged.

The Mothman Prophecies is a throwback to the time when "horror movie" didn't actually mean "Teenage Gore Fest." I guess the word for it now would be 'thriller,' and thrill it does.

Based on a true story from Point Pleasant, West Virginia in 1967, the Mothman takes place in present 2001, or thereabouts. It's the story of a newspaper reporter who finds himself in said town on his way to interview the governor. There he stumbles across several bizarre occurances; namely repeated sightings by the townsfolk of a not-quite-seen ethereal creature, and how these strange tales seem to intertwine with the reporter's own life.

The director, Mark Pellington (whose directorial credits include the mediocre movie Arlington Road and the music video of "Jeremy" by Pearl Jam) has created a mood and a tension in film that I don't think has appeared since The Exorcist in 1973. And he does so without blood, gore, or cheap scares.
And only a PG-13 rating.

Mr. Pellington falls backs on some outdated "tricks" like good acting, excellent cinematography, and an absolutely stunning soundtrack. Close-ups of the actors' faces here convey more real terror than in all the Friday the 13th films combined. The musical score sets the mood from scene 1 to the finale; dark and foreboding, tense and pensive. Sound work this good should have earned an Oscar nomination. The camera work is beyond reproach, as well. Sometimes long shots, setting a mood, sometimes jerky, fuzzy, or distorted like a funhouse mirror, all perfect to what needs to be conveyed - - without giving away too much.

The acting, also, is top notch. Richard Gere, Laura Linney, Will Patton, and Will &amp; Grace's Debra Messing all convey a range of emotions not seen in modern day thrillers in sometime.

If there is a flaw to the Mothman Prophecies, it's that the townspeople are too quick to tell a stranger of their paranormal experiences. A moments' hesitation, a shifting away of the eyes, the use of a softer-spoken voice in public would have made the stories and the characters come more alive, and added only a minute or two to the films' overall length.

Counting Memento, this is the second great film I've seen in the past thirteen months. Get it while you can.

"The Mothman Prophecies" is one of those rare films where everything magically 'works' resulting in a magnificent piece of cinematic art.

Richard Gere plays John Klein, a journalist for The Washington Post who is trying to come to grips with the sudden death of his wife. He soon finds himself mysteriously translated to the town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia. He develops a relationship with the sympathetic but skeptical local police sergeant, played by Laura Linney. They soon learn that many of the town's residents have sighted an eerie moth-like entity, similar to the one Klein's wife saw before she died. Deeper investigation causes Klein to have his own creepy encounters with the strange creature; he becomes convinced that the being exists on a sphere far beyond humanity's finite comprehension and that it can predict impending calamities. In fact, he comes to realize that this "mothman" is trying to warn the small town of one. Can he decipher what specifically the tragedy will be and when it will occure? Can he save his life and his loved ones before it's too late?

"The Mothman Prophecies" is not a monster movie, nor is it a mad-slasher horror flick; it's a creepy supernatural/mystery story with loads of mood &amp; atmosphere. Every element of this motion picture skillfully works -- acting, story, editing, score, cinimatography, locations, etc.

Sensitive viewers will note an undeniable reverent, beautiful quality to the film. The ending is touching in a very powerful way. I'll put it this way, if you appreciated "The Village," you'll love this one.

The notable Amazon reviewer Lawrence Bernabo claims that the mysteries presented in the story are not supposed to be figured out and, indeed, CANNOT be figured out. This is completely untrue. One must understand that this film is brilliantly intricate. Many questions are raised with varying possible answers. Don't think for a second that there are no real answers in this film; they're all there, but you may have to watch it about four or five times to finally discover them. I appreciate the fact that the director and writer refused to spell everything out for the viewer, even allowing room for complete misinterpretation. If the viewer wants answers s/he must have "ears to hear" and be willing to work for them.

My initial interpretation was that the mothmen are good spiritual beings that are trying to help humankind by predicting great calamities but can be easily misunderstood because they are so far superior to humans. In a nutshell my interpretation was that the "mothman" brought Gere to Point Pleasant to meet and save the future replacement for his dead wife, who died due to a pre-existing condition that only the mothman knew about. This explanation obviously suggests that the "mothmen" are good in nature.

I've come to see that this translation is false; a brilliantly implemented red herring. 

[SPOILER ALERT -- Don't read the following paragraphs unless you want to consider insights into the true nature of the mothmen]

The mothmen are in truth evil spirits, fallen angels or demons (they're synonymous). This is clear when viewing eye-witness drawings of the creatures; these pictures never show beautiful angel-like beings, but rather disturbing obviously-malevolent winged-creatures.

A mothman (evil spirit) CAUSED the auto accident that injured Debra Messing. Would a GOOD angelic being cause such a tragedy (regardless of the fact that she ultimately dies of a pre-existing problem)?  

The bible calls Satan the "prince of the power of the air," hence, his underlings (demons) are spiritual and electro-magnetic in nature. They can thus easily manipulate a traffic light or speak through a phone that's not plugged in. They can even take human form, like the male nurse who insists Debra's drawings are of "angels" and then mysteriously vanishes, or mimic the voices of dead loved ones.

The researcher from Chicago reveals that the mothmen are from hell (the spiritual underworld that underpins the earth) and send out mixed messages to ruin peoples lives. They may seem to be benevolently warning humans but, at the same time, are obvious instigators of human tragedies (the car crash, Gordon's job loss, insanity &amp; ultimate demise and the researcher's loss of his family &amp; a respectable social life, etc.). Also consider the fact that they refuse to reveal their true selves and intentions. They are highly skilled masqueraders.

The reclusive researcher also points out that they have been around for a millenia and therefore see things at least 2 or 3 moves ahead of humans; they naturally use this vantage point to manipulate, deceive and destroy.

The saved police woman, number "37" (research that number), in the end is still a victim  in that her previous views that the mothmen are evil and destructive could now flip-flop into the deception that the they are somehow agents of good. Of course we never find out if this happens because the tale potently ends with Gere and Linney in shock sitting in an ambulance just glad to be alive.

The film powerfully reveals that humanity is caught in a cosmic war and that there are beings whose sole purpose is to ruin or destroy us. Failure to understand and tactically prepare can be fatal. The only true protection from these evil spiritual beings is reconciliation with God through Jesus Christ's blood shield of atonement (not that the movie ever reveals this). 

For more intriguing insights see Sam Damon Jr.'s outstanding review from October 27, 2002.

[END SPOILER ALERT]        

"Mothman" ranks up there with my all-time favorite movies.

This is a visually elegant and thematically frightening movie. It conjures up some authentically unearthly and mysterious atmosphere. Once agan the outstanding musical accompaniment of TOMANDANDY helps to elevate the film to a level of dread not seen since DON'T LOOK NOW back in '73. This was a strangely malinged and neglected film at the time of its release but i think history will mark it out, alongside WHITE NOISE, as the best of the thrillers that came out in the wake of The success of THE SIXTH SENSE.

Three problems with this film:

1. PACING - The film's pacing doesn't vary.  It's very boring.  As a matter of fact, this wouldn't be a problem if the film were much more tense (e.g., "Speed"), however this film lacks the high-action intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed.  

2. EFFECTS - Too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions, and there is an overabundance of high-speed imaging.  The scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling "horror" scenes.  Furthermore, they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole.  The upshot: the film relies too heavily on the art of editing, to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting.  

3. TRIVIALITY - The plot's conclusion quails in the face of the "so what?" question.  The viewer is left with a sense of, "I sat through the film for THAT?"  In light of points (1) and (2), this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake.  

Don't waste your life.

I watched this movie not knowing all that much about about the whole Mothman phenomenon, so fortunately wasn't in a position to have my expectations dashed.  I guess that's the thing about movies based on real or alleged events, and there's not much that can be done about it if you've already read up on the whole incident.  The movie should be taken for what it is, a good, spine chilling paranormal thriller.  The Special edition includes a 50 minute documentary on the 1960s Mothman sightings on which the movie is based.  Very interesting in its own right

Main Line, Main Line.... those Main Liners.... You like to look at those Main Liners, don't you Ginger... I mean Kitty?  You the suffragette who just got offa the suffragette wagon...  the same wagon that was seen rolling by in The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle... wait a minute... that was the exact same footage!  I guess the makers of this fine movie assembled it out of stock footage.  In fact Wynn, the MAIN LINER seems to be assembled out of stock footage of Bill Clinton.  Did you know allabout the MAIIINNNE LIIIIINNNEEE????  Seems the whole worl knows about the MAIIIIIIINNNNEEE LIIIIIIINNNNNNEEEEEEE "Philadelphia Aristocracy"  See, in Philadelphia, they're old skool, dig.  They even got a Queen of Pennsylvania, who sits on a throne and stuff.  Played by Margaret Dumont when she's not getting scandalized by Groucho Marx.  And I believe there is a duke and duchess of Bakersfield.  And just the other day I had tea and crumpets with the Viscount of Compton.  Of the Night Train...  I mean Wild I... I mean Yeah, he was drinking Ripple back when Redd Foxx was merely the Duke of Cornwall.  He was in line to the throne... or was that waiting for the mens room... See, over here in the States we take our aristocracy just as seriously as our Prussian counterparts.  We are always to be seen marching around with those spiky helmets on, saluting the statue of Kaiser Bill's moustache

"Kitty Foyle" is a provocative depiction of class and gender politics during the era preceding World War II in America.  The film bluntly displays how your happiness could be impeded by your station in life and if you are a woman it's that much harder.  There are no real villains in the piece other than the archaic mores set down for generations.  Interesting, though based on a novel by Christopher Morley, the script was adapted by Dalton Trumbo who would later be blacklisted.  Ginger Rogers, in a performance of great strength and nuance, more than earned her Oscar for her work here.  Those who would dismiss her as Fred Astaire's dance partner should check out her work in films like "42nd Street" and "Stage Door"

I had heard all the hype about this film and Ginger's Oscar, but after several viewings, I still find the film rather flat as an experience, and Ginger's Oscar is still a mystery.  I guess it proves the adage about winning one "For women, play plain or ugly (remember Charlize Theron) or play against type"

Ginger Rogers was very popular, both within the Hollywood community, and with the moviegoing public. With two strong performances in 1940, she took home the Oscar despite strong competition. Rogers perfectly captured the dilema of every American girl who worked for a living. Her portrayel of a young woman having to decide between a young woman's daydream of what love would be like and the real thing is flawless. Sam Wood directed this very entertaining film based on Christopher Morley's popular book. 

Ginger is Kitty Foyle, a career girl from Philadelphia who falls for her boss, Wyn Strafford (Dennis Morgan), in what she thinks is everything she's dreamed about all her life. Wood used a snowglobe as a transitional device to Kitty's flashbacks of their romance, just as George Stevens had used a phonograph in Penny Serenade the previous year. Kitty and Wyn are no longer together, their brief marriage ending in divorce when it finally becomes clear to Kitty that her Irish American moxie can not overcome Wyn's old-money family in their Darby Mill--Griscom Street romance. 

Kitty has moved on and has a chance for something real with a young but poor doctor portrayed by James Craig. But it is a down to earth and more practical love, and when Wyn suddenly appears to take her away once more, but not as his wife, she must decide which path to choose. As she packs to run away with Wyn, she argues with her conscience and remembers. 

Ernest Cossart is very good as Kitty's pop, trying to steer her in the right direction. He may have been born four drinks below par, as Kitty affectionately teases him, but he is wise enough to see Wyn's weak character, which will never allow him to break from his society family and make a real life with his daughter. Kitty will face two tragedies simultaneously in this warm and sentimental story of an American working girl trying to have it all. 

Rogers did deserve the Oscar because she is everything in this film. She may have been the only actress around who could have so readily been accepted to represent an entire generation of young women during the 1940's. They viewed her as one of their own, even though the glamour of Hollywood was part of her story as well. She was the American girl made good, and her performance here is flawless. 

A fine ending showed not only Kitty's Irish American moxie, but her growth and maturity as well. This is a fine film with a terrific performance from Ginger Rogers that is very much a product of the era it was made. A fine score from Roy Webb adds to this gentle story of letting the dream of love go in favor of the real thing. A must own for Ginger's fans and a good one for film buffs to add to their collection

Ginger won the Oscar for playing this part despite some stiff competition.  She's decidedly out of character as a white-collar girl with an old school attitude.  I love when she grumbles, "People always make a big deal about the Old West and the brave women of the covered wagons.  They don't seem to care as much about their modern-day equivalents, the secretaries--the women of the covered typewriters."  With her quivering lower lip and her turned-up chin, she makes us care for Kitty Foyle, a girl from the poor side of the tracks who makes good with the rich playboy Wynnewood Strafford the III, or for short, "Win," played skillfully by the wonderful Dennis Morgan, possibly Hollywood's most under-rated star player of the 1940s.  Morgan could sing too but he was best playing men whose love for their leading lady was always tested by some kind of addiction or other handicap, some sort of weakness.  Here his Achilles heel is his family and their swanky social position.

Gladys Cooper would have a fit if she found out that Dennis was dating Ginger Rogers, and in the book of course, Kitty and Win don't get married but carry on a "back street" sex affair anyhow.  Moviegoers even in 1940s were agile enough to read between the lines and to guess that the baby Ginger loses in the movie was a real "love child."  You'd have to have a heart of stone not to feel strangle prickles behind your eyes, like tears, when Ginger realizes that she has lost the baby.  Luckily Dr. Mark is there to pick up the pieces--James Craig, another very good actor, playing a young intern who loves Kitty even despite the fact that her father's a boozehound and she will never enter the Social Register or Main Line Philly society.  I wonder if Grace Kelly ever saw KITTY FOYLE and based some of her choices in men on Kitty's Philadelphia binary.  Between this film and BACHELOR MOTHER you would think Ginger Rogers a very maternal figure, but anyone who met her in real life knew that there was no room for children in her heart; in some ways she was a very lonely lady despite her many accomplishments and all the famous men she attracted to her side (think "Lady in the Dark," probably the part she played that was the most like the real life Ginger Rogers.")

The subtitle of this movie was "The Natural History of a Woman" and was supposed to provide a quasi-scientific, or sociological, study of class.  Far from it, but it's a treat anyhow

Any best actress oscar winner of 1940 would have been controversial. I think Ginger deserved it as well as any of the others. She is wonderful in this drama, and she portrays KItty with a certain realness. watch her facial expressions. I believe that Ginger had the most expressive and beautiful eyes in hollywood history. after losing her baby in childbirth, kitty's look on her face whenever she sees a child afterwards is devestating. the whole cast is fine, and you could cut Gin and Dennis Morgan's chemistry with a knife. Ginger had a strange power to bring out so much chemistry from all her leading men. In the early scenes, she is adorable as little kitty. I don't believe that this is a soap opera, because the situations are NOT ridiculous and the characters are very real, but nevertheless it is a heavier type of drama, so don't expect a SWING TIME-like experience, and keep the tissues handy. I highly recommend this film, not only for Ginger's performance, but for the movie as a whole

Danny Parker is a meth addict and a snitch for the police as well.  He used to be Tom Van Allen, before the death of his wife in an unrelated drug raid near the Salton Sea.  From Tom the trumpet player to Danny the addict, Danny's downward spiral has had a purpose.

With a single piece of evidence from the murder of his wife, a red hair, Tom/Danny has planned revenge for a long time based on a single vision of a person at a gas station.  He intends to trap the red-haired stranger in a quarter-million dollar drug deal with a psycho called Pooh-Bear.

I don't want to say much more, which would reveal too much of the plot, but I will say that this film relies on atmosphere, photography, great acting, and visuals rather than script.  I felt the script was the weakest part, but the rest of its components compelled me towards its rather predictable ending.  It's a bit twisted and unleveled, but in the end that works for the movie rather than against it.

Val Kilmar (Willow, Alexander, Wonderland) is good in his role, as he always is, but Vincent D'Onofrio (Men In Black, The Cell) steals the show as Pooh-Bear.  D'Onofrio was meant to play the bad parts, evidenced by his ability to carry the movie, 'The Cell', all on his own (Lopez made the movie worse, not better).  Peter Sarsgaard (Shattered Glass, The Cell) carries his share of the weight in this flick just as he did with D'Onofrio in The Cell.  These two actors obviously work well together.  Look for singer Meat Loaf in an almost unrecognizable role as Bo.  B.D. Wong (Executive Decision) is at top form as his role of financer/agent Bubba.

'The Salton Sea' is a good movie to flesh out your drug habit, as far as movies go, but I haven't decided whether or not it is worth a purchase yet.  Definitely worth a rent, though.  Plus, you have to absolutely LOVE that tattoo on Danny!  Enjoy!

This film may be well one the most original, chilling, powerful, potent and gratifying American Noir in years. 

Frame by frame, this somber portrait about a man who lost his wife in an absurd skirmish, because of both of them were in the wrong place at the wrong moment, will induce him to plan a dark and meticulous vengeance, that will lead him to become a talebearer to get to infiltrate in the underworld and so to gain the deserved trust to get close the expected target.

But in the meantime, the journey is hard to be a piece of cake. He will face the dense brume of the nasty jungle of dealers and corrupted officers. But if you, additionally, consider the prodigious angle shots, the overwhelming photography, the surprising information around it, the fine performances and the claustrophobic locations, this sum will compensate by far, all your efforts to get it, rent it and even acquire for your personal collection.    

A very well made razor edge thriller that will maintain you hold on your seat.

Thanks for the fine actors for supporting this quirky, violent film.  Many of them play against type and Vince D. creates an original sadistic dealer.  Hopefully no one will try to emulate his sick torturing ways in real life.

Basically the story is a mystery and the layers unfold as the story moves along.  In many ways it is a conventional mystery but with highly original characters.  Kilmer does some of his best work and you have to wonder if his bad boy antics have affected his ability to get roles since he delivers such a great performance.  Too bad this is such a litlle known film.  It deserves better

The Salton Sea is a dismal place, and it's metaphor for all the bad that happened in Tom Van Allen's (Val Kilmer) life.  It's a modern film noir, and Kilmer does a good job in capturing the torment of a drug addict.  Unforgettable characters and a dark glimpse into a world I knew nothing about, except what I've heard on 60 Minutes, and some very black humor.  The special features are especially enlightening with (Director) Caruso's commentary.  Check it out...if you like independent films you won't be disappointed

Excellence in story-writing.  The script is elusive and well-structured; and the performances were precise.

The story is the strength of this film---which is accompanied by the examination of the soul which takes place throughout.  Val Kilmer's predicament, which is not completely shown at the beginning of the movie but in retrospect undoubtedly sets the stage for the entire film, is gut-wrenching.

I can't express enough the level to which I enjoyed the combination of Kilmer/D'Onofrio/etc...'s performances and the script

This film reminded me a lot of "Casino" - interesting story, appealing actors, good sets, dialog and costumes - but they also share one more characteristic - they both feature several souless, sadistic characters who perform horrific acts of brutality. 
The best thing about this movie is Val Kilmer. I think he was in most, if not every scene, and he narrates the story all the way through. I think Kilmer has one of the most expressive voices of American actors working in film today, so hearing him narrate was a treat! He plays a sensitive musician in love with his beautiful, adventurous wife and has the terrible misfortune of watching her being murdered just for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Now full of grief, he spends his days and nights bluffing his way through a bleak landscape of drug-pushers and drug-users in order to lay a trap for his wife's killer. Jimmy-the-Finn - the angel-faced drug-user who just wants to be liked - is also a great character. His friendship with Kilmer's character is the heart of the movie. Other secondary characters are also good including the gun salesman and the two bad cops.
I give this story 4 stars because it is not something I would buy and watch over and over again -- the afore-mentioned souless characters are just too much for a sensitive person to contemplate

(3.5 STARS) D. J. Caruso's Stylish Noir with Interesting Characters (and Character Actors)

Before shooting the so-so thriller 'Taking Lives' featuring Angelina Jolie, D. J. Caruso gathered talented character actors (or some of them are determined method actors) for this stylish film noir shot in the sunny California. The script is too complicated with flashbacks, but for all its implausible story the film is always entertaining with a clever use of the camera and some interesting (or crazy) characters that you find it funny to see, but you don't want to know personally.

Standard film review requires a plot summery, but in 'The Salton Sea' it doesn't work. So I strongly advise that if you like good dialogues and unpredictable story, you should watch it without reading anything about the film including mine. I can also promise some moments of darkly funny humor and strange characters including our hero running away from his demon, plus good acting from Val Kilmer and Vincent D'Onofrio (who has no nose) and the moody photography by Amir Mokri ('Don't Say a Word' and 'Taking Lives').

[MINOR SPOILERS ALERT!!!] The film is a noir mystery, which begins with Val Kilmer's character sitting on the floor, playing the trumpet somewhere in the burning house. His languid voiceover tells us about the things in the past, about the days when he was dealing with chemicals. At first the film looks like a Tarantino-style half-comic, half-serious drama about some crime. Crimes are involved, to be sure, but the film soon shows another much darker aspect.

The film is partly a revenge story, but its revenge part cannot be revealed here. Apparently, the film suggests, Val Kilmer's character has one aim right ahead of him. He has a huge tatoo on his back; he keeps in touch with two guys who are not always nice to him; and he says he has two names. But his real purpose of life will not be clear until the last 30 minutes.

[COMPLICATED STORY] If you dissect all the pages of the script, rearrange the parts, and see the whole thing once again, you will notice that the story itself is very implausible. The film knows it, however, and is self-conscious, even calling its own wrap-up a 'cliche.' But perhaps the mystery is not the point. It's about how to present it, and 'The Salton Sea' succeeds on that score. Its humor is sometimes excessive, or too silly -- see the ridiculous re-enactment scene of 'JFK' -- but good actors are fun to see. Besides Kilmer and D'Onofrio, Adam Goldberg, Luis Guzmn, Deborah Kara Unger, B.D. Wong, Peter Sarsgaard, Doug Hutchison, and Anthony LaPaglia appear, with bits of R. Lee Ermey, Danny Trejo, Meat Loaf. 

The film is a noir, and like any noir the story is complicated and often implausible. But film is always slick and stylish, and manages to engae the fans of the genre

We didn't know what to expect from this - our only link to the title was Val Kilmer, who's a favourite actor of ours.  We were both pleasantly and disturbingly engaged during the movie - the characters slowly grew on us, especially Vincent D'onofrio's who we remember from Full Metal Jacket.  And,it's one of the movies where we couldn't get enough of the Special Features! (We only access Special Features when it's a great movie!

Richard Donner's "Maverick" probably deserves ample recognition as among the funniest westerns ever made since Mel Brooks's "Blazin' Saddles". Based on the atypical 1960s television western starring James Garner, Mel Gibson does a great job taking over from Garner as the suave, debonair gambler Brett Maverick, en route to the World Series of Poker in Saint Louis, Missouri. He joins forces with  a younger, ambitious gambler Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster), who is as sly as a fox, older U. S. marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner) and a sympathetic Indian pal (Graham Greene). Both Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster are hysterically funny, giving us two of their finest portrayals in their long cinematic careers. Along the way they have to contend with a devious gambler (Alfred Molina) and a whole colorful assortment of other ill-mannered Wild West bad guys (Many of these are portrayed by some legendary actors from the great Hollywood westerns, like James Coburn and Denver Pyle.). Donner does a fine job directing his cast, which apparently had a lot of fun making this film since the chemistry amongst Gibson, Foster and Garner is absolutely superb

From the director of "Lethal Weapon" and "Superman" and it shows.  Really enjoyed this film.  Spectacular shots of the West - shot in Yosemite.  Mel Gibson is looking old - like early 40s - but his blue eyes and long lashes are still something.  He's too comic here, as he has been of late.  I much preferred him in "Mrs. Soffell" and "Hamlet".  And James Garner was perfect - all cool to Gibson's manic energy.  And tons and tons of cameos, from Danny Glover, to Doug McClure, to Robert Fuller.  But Gibson was not as smooth as Garner in the original "Maverick", nor in fact did he seem to have the same confidence in himself.  The movie was entertaining but gimmicky, from the borrowings from "Lethal Weapon" and "Raiders" to Graham Greene's wisecracking Indian.  It was just a little too precious.  Gibson should go back to serious stuff. (And look what he does now!) I must admit the ending caught me.  I had not a clue.  But as a fun movie, it definitely works.  James Coburn must be mentioned.  He looked great, sounded great, was great.  How old is he anyway?  Mel Gibson should age so well.  And a beautiful old steamboat.  Plot was all about poker and money, what else

This is a western because it takes place in the old west but that is not what this film is all about. It is about laughs. It is a comedy that takes place in the old west.

Mel Gibson plays a professional gambler, Brett Maverick,  who wants to pit his skills against the best poker players around in a big tournament. The entry fee is 25,000 and the prize is half a million dollars. He has most of his stake and lots of people owe him money but everything seems to go wrong as he tries to collect the money due him, always with hilarious results. As he makes his way towards to tournament, he encounters another gambler, played by Jodie Foster, who also wants to enter the tournament. She too is a bit short of a stake and will stop at nothing to get into the tournament and this includes playing the vamp and the pickpocket. The final main character is the US Marshall played by James Garner. He does not seem interested in playing poker but he is on his way to the tournament as well. He has been hired to provide security.

As they make their way to the big event, all three of the protagonists take their shots at the others. The Indians get involved and come across as the funniest, most honest and most intelligent people around. They finally get Maverick his stake (with lots of laughs) and the stage is set for the big tournament.

The tournament itself is full of laughs, surprises, twists and turns. It also has a lot of cameo appearances from old time western stars. All of this is fun but the interplay between Gibson, Foster and Garner is the real fun. 

Get this one for the laughs and then prepare to hold your sides while you bust a gut laughing.

A 1990's Western comedy featuring Mel Gibson, Maverick was a breath of fresh air when first appeared in theaters. The film doesn't take itself so seriously as many films with a Western setting tend to do. Based on the 1950's television series by the same name in which James Garner had a starring role, Maverick is a uniquely clever and entertaining adventure comedy...

When Bret Maverick (Mel Gibson) needs $25,000 to enter a winner-take-all poker tournament, he travels through towns en route to the tournament in the hopes of winning every dollar he needs. But he quickly encounters Angel (Alfred Molina), a roughneck poker player in his own right who tries to kill Maverick (his attempt inevitably fails).

Along the way, Maverick meets up with Ms. Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) - a slick, conniving poker player who picks Maverick's pocket following a brief romantic encounter. When Maverick catches her, he forces her to wash his shirt as punishment. Shrinking his designer shirt, Annabelle runs off to catch a riverboat with Maverick running after her. After boarding the boat, the two are joined by Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner) - a kind, retired sheriff famous throughout the West. Cooper's chivalry and hospitality greatly contrast with Maverick's brisk demeanor when it comes to dealing with Ms. Bransford.

As the three travel cross country, they face a series of pitfalls such as a dead coach driver who almost runs their coach off the top of a cliff, a showdown with hundreds of Indians, and Maverick's financial dealings with an Archduke from Russia. Separated in the confusion, the three eventually meet again on the Riverboat Lauren Belle, home of the championship poker game hosted by the riverboat's owner Commodore Duvall. Making use of his quick wit, Maverick raises the extra cash he needs to join the poker game (as well as a few thousand extra for Annabelle Bransford). Commodore Duvall puts Marshal Zane Cooper in charge of guarding the $500,000 in entry fees for the tournament in which Angel also happens to be a participant.  But in addition to beating Angel, Maverick faces other obstacles of even greater challenge...

Overall, Maverick is great entertainment. The acting is superb on all fronts with standout performances by Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster, and James Garner. Each of the main characters creates a likeable persona. And what makes this movie a must-see (because the plot leaves much to be desired) is the ability of the on-screen characters to create a personal connection with the audience. Several of the scenes in this film are absolutely hilarious, such as the ones with Joseph (Graham Greene). Maverick isn't the type of movie that will win Academy Awards or leave one pondering the fundamental principles of the universe, but it is a whole lot of fun. And if you want to do is laugh, give this movie a try...

With a renewed interest of the "Western" genre in 80's &amp; 90's(YOUNG GUNS, TOMBSTONE, UNFORGIVEN) and classic tv series being made into films,MAVERICK was a natural. To sum up the film, it is just a plain fun. Richard Donner and Mel Gibson take their collaboration from the LETHAL WEAPON films (and even take Danny Glover along for a hilarious cameo as far as even saying "I'm getting too old for this  ----!") to make a very satisfying comedy-adventure-western.  Everyone seems to be having a good time in this film and the audience is brought along for the ride.  James Garner who originated the roll on tv is brought back as Marshall Zane Cooper.  Mel Gibson is perfectly cast in the lead and is so likeable and engaging that no matter what predicament he gets himself into, he's going to get out of it.  The plot is mainly Maverick trying to get to, and raise funds for, a poker tournament on a Louisiana steamboat. Along the way he runs into hilarious obstacles and miscreant while meeting up with unsavory charactors etc.  Jody Foster on the heels of two major best-actress Oscar wins, plays it light and is surprisingly hilarious as card shark/con artist Annabelle Bransford. Alfred Molina (SPIDER-MAN 2) shows his versatility once again as bad-guy  "Angel", Maverick's arch enemy. Graham Greene is hilarious as the politically incorrect Native American,Joseph who is after the mighty dollar. Also, a who's who of veteran tv and movie character actors appear in the film during the marathon poker tournament making it fun to point them out. Lastly, veteran James Garner is good in everything he does.  The closing scenes with Garner &amp; Gibson with a surprising revelation is one of the highlights of the film and totally satisfying.  Overall, fun, light, entertaining and perfect

PICTURE QUALITY = 4-SOUND QUALITY = 5+The overall picture quality is pleasant and satisfying. Color is nice but pxilazation is very present in the begining of movie. Improves as movie goes on. This being a very senic movie I was not completly happy but still satisfied. Could've been a bit sharper and remastered from high definition but wasnt.The sound quality in Dolby was awesome. Not in Dolby Digital but on a system with Pro Logic II it souded great if not better than most non-digital dolby surround. All surround sounds are present and really stood out. The soundtrack is placed perfectly and surrounds the room. Very happpy with this DVD sound quality.THE MOVIE - *note spolier. The movie was excellent in all entertainment areas if your looking for a FUN Western movie. Comedy, action, stunts, scenery, and many great actors. Everything you would want in a &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot; western film in the old fashioned tradition. Light on violence and good enough for the whole family.*Spoiler - The best (and my favorite) thing about this movie is the fact that James Garner still plays as Maverick even though the audience doesn't know it. Watching it over and knowing that Mel Gibson is playing his role as &amp;quot;the son of Maverick&amp;quot; and James Garner is still the orginal character he played in the past makes this a great movie to watch over and over.My overall review is that it is worth buying and I'd give it 5 stars if the picture was just a touch better. Don't be fooled though, I have a large projection widescreen tv with a progressive component DVD player so I see almost any grain there is if any is present. Overall this DVD was satisfying enough to make me happy I bought it. On any other tv it will display a perfect picture. Sound quality is great on a home theatre sound system.This is a movie that should be made on a Superbit DVD

I probably own four or five books on the 8 Pieces of Brocade, a Qigong exercise that at first does not appear to be complex or difficult to learn.    After reading the various books on this exercise I felt that I had a pretty good grasp of how to do the exercises and what to expect.    Watching this DVD was very enlightening and corrected some misconceptions I had about the exercises.    The book by Dr. Yang, Jwing Ming is excellent, but as suggested by the author, using the DVD and the book together is a very effective technique for obtaining accurate and effective results while doing this form.

The DVD offers both the Sitting and Standing versions of the 8 Pieces of Brocade exercise.    Dr. Yang starts off the DVD with a history of the 8 Pieces of Brocade, which was created approximately one thousand years ago.
The 8 Pieces of Brocade is presented in two main sections, the sitting version and the standing version.    First shown is an analysis of the steps in the sitting version.    

Throughout this analysis the DVD uses multiple angle shots to display the front, sides and rear of Dr. Yang as he demonstrates each of the movements.   Additionally, the added benefit of sound helps the student to realize for example how hard to tap the teeth, or when to breath in and out.   Even the tapping of the fingers on the back of the skull during one of the exercises helps the student to do the movement correctly by listening to the sound that is made when Dr. Yang demonstrates the movement.

Following a very detailed and clear presentation during the analysis of the 8 Pieces of Brocade, the form is then shown in its entirety.   With the convenient chapter markers available on the DVD, the student can easily follow along whatever section they choose.    The movement to DVD for the YMAA products has made learning much easier by allowing this convenient and instant access to any part of the material.

After the analysis of the sitting form of the 8 Pieces of Brocade, the DVD then presents the analysis of the standing form of the 8 Pieces of Brocade, followed by a continuous demonstration of the form.

The student is then treated to a lecture by Dr. Yang on the 8 Pieces of Brocade.   This lecture is approximately 50 minutes and has a wealth of information about the form.   Clever use of animation helps to illustrate the flow of chi that occurs while doing the form.

In my opinion, the way to learn martial arts successfully is to employ the following tools:

Instruction from a teacher

Studying printed material

Visualization in your mind

Self practice and study while doing the forms

Writing a journal to record what is learned or taught during each lesson
Watching videos of the teacher

Filming yourself and comparing it to the image you had in your mind of how you were doing the form

Socialize and share your knowledge with other students and work on the principles together

Try teaching one of the concepts, moves, techniques or applications to a person who has no knowledge of Taijiquan.    In the process you will easily learn as much as the person you are trying to teach.

This DVD is one of the above mentioned tools, and a wonderful addition for the serious student to learn and practice properly the 8 Pieces of Brocade.

This DVD lives up to its promises - it introduces you to the world of Qigong. I have personally practised some Qigong exercises before  - from some books - but after watching this DVD I realized that I was doing them somewhat wrong. I didn't see any of what I had been practising in this video, however, doing Qigong is like a poem (actually, it was a poem for ancient Chinese), like a moving meditation, it's soft and smooth, whereas I had a rigid and strict execution. This DVD presents two sets of exercises - sitting (on a bed, let's say) for elderly and weak people, and standing - for everyone else. There is a track presenting the history of Qigong, specifically this set, and detailed explanations of each exercise, including medical benefits (e.g. what internal organ you would be massaging by doing them). Granted, you need more information (e.g.on breathing - it is only briefly touched), but then again, a beginner could only get so much or else (s)he becomes scared of so many new things. Still, Dr. Yang has a book with the same title, I've ordered and received mine (but haven't started reading it yet), that should explain more things. The book and the video complement each other - the former has more information, but the latter shows you the execution. Get them both.
I'm also a beginner, and have no teacher, but apparently, looking at customer reviews for Qigong beginners, this is the course path that I recommend (that is what I am going to order and study, even if I get a teacher in the meantime):
- Stick to 8 Pieces of Brocade until you execute it well, and by that I mean not only physical execution - which you will probably get soon, it's very simple, but also mental - you master it when you are able to focus on it from beginning to end, or sort of.
- Get "Chi Kung: The Way of healing" by Master Lam Kam Chuen, those exercises should prepare you for the next stage
- Get "Chi Kung: The Way of energy" by Master Lam Kam Chuen and "Opening the energy gates of your body" by Bruce Frantzis Kumar, those books complement each other. Note that apparently all the exercise in "Way of healing" are actually easier selections from "Way of energy", so don't be surprised. I guess, because of this you could skip the "Way of healing" phase completely.
When all the above is done - you should have greatly improved your energetics, but it could take years or even a lifetime without a teacher. You are then ready to study Dr. Yang's other books - I won't write the relevant ones here (although I had started too, but removed the paragraph), by then you should know which they are, they don't belong in this beginner's review. Anyway, at that stage you should probably get a teacher.
In short, this is a nice beginner's introduction, short of having a teacher. Did I mention to get a teacher

I have had this a while, but haven't used it since it's so easy, it's boring. Therefore, I only use it when I'm not feeling well. 
Recently I had a severe allergic reaction &amp; used this. I have been using herbs &amp; acupuncture, but I really felt so much better faster using this to build up my energy. Even when I was very dizzy &amp; felt horrible, I went very slowly on the standing exercises &amp; felt much better after, more energy deep down &amp; was able to fall asleep faster then I had in days. 
The sitting ones are even more easy for those who cannot stand. 
In the demonstration/how-to area, there is an English or American narrator while they show a clip of Dr. Yang doing the exercises a few times. In another section, the practice is Dr. Yang shows you the complete exercises about 3-20x each which only takes about 10-15 min. Unfortunately on mine, in this section, the sound seems to be faster/off by 3-5 full seconds. 
Like almost all Qi Gong videos, they all say once you start, you must complete it &amp; I always do a return to chi motion. 
There are A LOT of extras. There is a nice amount of lecture about the basics of energy flow &amp; how Qi Gong works. This dvd is almost two hours long, so you are getting your money's worth. Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming is one man any serious martial artist I have ever talked to knows &amp; has read about.
There are trailers on his site at ymaa

 An excellent DVD for someone to begin practicing qigong. Easy to learn and beautiful to look at, these exercises are the most effective and popular qigong movements for the last 1,000 years.

 This DVD also has a lot of information on it for someone interested in learning more and going deeper, with a long instructional section with Master Yang, where he explains exactly how and why these qigong exercises work. He goes into great detail explaining the breathing and qi energy, with specific instruction on many skills, such as generating 'guardian qi' to protect your health.

His teaching style is very clear and, balanced with evidence from Western medical society and a lot of historical knowledge, this is the most complete qigong video out there. He shows how to do each move in various ways, depending if you are flexible already or not. Clearly, he is experienced with teaching students of all ages and health levels.

The subtitles are great, the Glossary of Chinese terms pertaining to Chinese qigong is amazing, and the half hour of trailers for other YMAA Tai Chi and Kung Fu videos is inspiring

I was introduced to the benefits of Qigong by a good friend a few months ago. I noticed that it had immediate physical benefits. I had been searching for a practice that would help increase my physical energy.

This is a wonderful introduction to Qigong for beginners. I bought the video on the recommendations of the reviewers here and have not been disappointed. Plus it is a very reasonable cost compared to the other options.

Dr. Yang gives very clear and concise explanations of the theory behind the poses. The exercises are simple to do. I have started with the sitting exercises and am doing them morning and night the past few days.

I suffer from chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia and bought this to improve the energy flow in my body. I have been feeling very weak lately due to lack of sleep and stress and found that the poses gave me immediate benefit by taking a layer of pain off my body. I am sleeping better too. I will check back in 3 months to update the benefits.

Also it became clear to me from watching the DVD that the problems I am having are energy problems. After doing the exercises I could feel the chi flowing in parts of my body that have been blocked -- namely my feet and arms. I also noticed that my kidneys are extremely sore and probably depleted. I was shocked. These exercises made me more aware of what is really going on in my body.

The sitting exercises are great for those who need to take it slow. To the senior gentleman who was upset that Dr. Yang didn't go into modifications. Yes, you are right, but you needn't worry if you can't stretch all the way to your toes. Just stretch as far forward as you can comfortably do. He also says in his analysis that the repetitions are guidelines -- and to do what you can.

A great DVD. I can't wait to see how I'm feeling in a few months. The DVD made me realize that I need to renergize my kidney's and I am buying herbal tea and herbs to assist in that process. I for one am tired of exercise that pushes the body past it's limits. This set of poses works with the body that you have now

As a 15 year practicioner of Tai Chi Chuan this system of QiGong and this DVD in particular is one of the best I have ever seen. It goes into just the right amount of detail and description, is beautifully done and clearly, Dr. Yang is a gifted teacher. I have seen MANY martial art training videos and the quality of this is way above par. This is a beautiful QiGong form that is sure to bring health to anyone who practices daily. It's the real deal!

I really enjoyed watching this DVD and was suprised at how easy it was to memorize the different positions.  I was able to learn so quickly because of the very informative and clear explanations.  This DVD is a very high quality production and incredibly informative.  After studying it for a week I feel that I know enough about the basics of Chi Kung to teach it to others.  It was great to learn more about the history of Chi Kung also.  I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to quickly learn about the 8 pieces of brocade and how to perform the exercise sets

I must say that 'Best Laid Plans' is in a league of it's own.  I have never seen a movie that took me for the turns this film did, and anyone who says that they guessed the ending is just lying to make their hatred for this movie resonate.  This film may not be perfect, and there are some boring scenes as they try to hard to explain the state Nick is in, but the overall plot of this film is one I've never seen done before.  From the opening scene in the bar when Reese enters till you find her chained up in the basement and she tells Nick "we're screwed" you start to realize that what you think you know, you don't...and thats the case throughout this entire movie.  From the start to the finish you have no clue who's involved in what.  When Nick (Nivola) makes the bad choice of stealing some dope with friends and his friends are caught he ends up at the bad end of the gun.  He has just a few days to get $15,000 or he's going to be worse than dead...Then his friend Brice (Brolin) moves back and Nick and Lissa (Witherspoon) come up with a plan, only it backfires, and then they find a way out of it, but that plan backfires and before you know it their back where they started, litterally.  THis movie, for all it's twists and turns and ORIGINALITY, while not being perfect still is a recomended film for anyone who wants to see something fresh and different than the normal popcorn munching drama.  4 1/2 stars

At first glance this would appear to be a VERY serious movie.   The opening 1/2 hour or so reminded me of the movie BODY SHOTS, which is a rather disturbing film.   What is most intriguing about this story is that it is a complete farce and the movie seems to change colors like some sort of a chameleon.   What you end up with is something totally different than what you think you're getting in the beginning.

Reese Witherspoon stars once again as a sort-of young girl lost type persona.   She seems to be somewhat typecast for this type of role as in many ways her character is not so different from the ones she portrayed in TWILIGHT and FREEWAY.   While the present film is not quite as off-the-wall as FREEWAY, it is still pretty far out in left-field.

If you're a fan of Reese Witherspoon or films that are on the fringes of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, this one might be for you.  While there are many obvious clues during the film as to what's going on, I did not take them seriously enough to figure this plotline out before the final revelation.   Can you

This film illistrates the human desire for freedom.  A man (Nivola) has fallen in a hole and he needs cash fast.  His girfriend (Witherspoon) goes to the extremes to dig him out.  This is Witherspoons finest role yet.  She takes you deep inside her characters mind and shows how love and compassion direct the character through her toughest decisions.  Lissa (witherspoon) and her boyfriend (Nivola) need to get out of this town- find out what they will do to do so

Great film.

Ted Griffin's script is far more powerfull than , say, 'The Usual Suspects'--A fun film with a fun plot twist--but that's a box office handicap. A powerfull story can be powerfully disturbing . . .

We can be frightened by the bigger than life bad guy  'Keesyer Sosa' in  "Suspects"  with complete detatchment.  After all, what are the chances this crazed monster is going to blow up your house? 

It's like watching Dracula. It's fun to be scared precisely because we don't believe in vampires. 

But in 'The Best Laid Plans ' No boats explode, no running gun battles ensue and we are firmly in America, not Transylvania.

Where, to permit myself an understatement, sometimes there's a problem with money . . .

 So if you were truly desperate, how far would you go to save your skin?  Ask the woman you love to have sex with a patsy you can blackmail?  Sell out a friend to The Allmighty Dollar? 

(Wonderfully used by the writer in the metaphor of a rare bill worth a fortune)

I mean if your life was on the line with the mob at your heels and the clock was running out, the honorable thing for you to do would be . . ?

The hero falls short of heroics here---no wonder they couldn't get a name star to play the male lead--what would his fans think?

It's odd how citics are fond of cliche statements about film noir being  a genre that 'exposes the dark underside of our culture'--but when a film truly does so with uncompromising brilliance, it's  apparently time to back down and go on the scary ride at the amusement park instead. Or make yet another remake of Dracula.

Pity. 

A stylish and suspenseful film.

A+   Film Noir

I have watched Sesame Street all my life. I enjoyed it immensly when I was a wee lad in the early eighties, and throughout my life watching it with little cousins and whatnot. Since my baby son has become able to watch the show, I started a few months back collecting various DVD's. Lets face it, Sesame Street is the ONLY show for kids that I can enjoy as much as the kids. Its hillarious- even the new ones are pretty good. BUT this DVD is gold. Stuffed with the bits and sketches that are harder to find... (although the show does still make an effort to work in some of these oldies on the regular which I must applaud) ... these are the ones that I was looking for in the first place. The ones that I watched when I was a kid...
However, some of the stuff in this disc are even a little strange to me, since they were retired before I was born. Most noticeable is the early Big Bird, who seems to be a little autistic, I'm not sure. Also, the first three seasons had a different guy playing the role of Gordon. Other than that pretty much all the adult characters are the same... Mr. Hooper was before my time, but I had heard of him plenty of times.. and Maria! Wow, she was like seventeen when this show started... she was a fox! ... Hola means hello, Maria... 
Anyway, I cant wait to get down with my two year old and watch the entire seven hours of this thing. Old School Sesame Street RULES!!! Its funny, its got a real laid back chill groove, that is great for calming down the kids a bit.. And YES, still way more educational than about 90 percent of what I see on PBS these days

There is a disclaimer on this set that warns that the material presented in this dvd may not meet the educational needs of today's children. My advice is to IGNORE this ridiculous warning. The material presented on this dvd is some of the best work Sesame Street ever produced. Sure some of its dated, but what a perfect opportunity to talk to your kids about history,culture, and all sorts of things. 
I really loved this DVD. It brought back many happy memories of watching the show and I was surprised as to how many skits I remembered.
This is a definate Muppet must -have,along with the Muppet Show,Christmas Eve on Sesame Street,Muppet Family Christmas, and the first three Muppet movies

In the evenings my young son and I sit down to eat dinner in front of the TV set (yes, I know it's bad parenting to plop a kid in front of a TV at mealtime) and usually "Sesame Street" is what we are watching. Like most pre-schoolers, he enjoys the Muppet characters, the humorous plotlines and hopefully he's getting something educational out of it. But as 42 year old Dad, who was a child of the '60s and has sweet rose colored, nostalgic memories of growing up in the '70s, it just seems like something is missing from what I remember. Now, I don't want to bash the current show. For my money it's still the best educational programming for Pre-schoolers on the tube today. But had I outgrown it? Or is the Elmo/Mr. Noodle version of the show, somehow different? 

Well, recently I got my answer, when I gave my son the newly released DVD boxset, "Sesame Street, Old School (1969-1974)" for his fifth birthday. (O.K., who am kidding? I was actually buying it for myself.) Once, I put these discs on and the opening credits started, it was like a powerful wave of nostalgia ran over me.I instantly started singing the bouncey, unforgettable theme song and as the show's opening rolled by, I started recognizing the mostly urban, kids (and the seal) that had been indelibly etched in my mind (my favorite is the pensive little girl on the tricycle).

Watching these early episodes on disc makes me realize just how how revolutionary, energetic, imaginative and well written this show really was in it's early years. I love the amazing animation segments, that taught numbers and the alphabet with humor and just a touch of pychedelia. Early versions of the Muppet characters are there, including Big Bird (with a smaller head), Bert &amp; Ernie, Oscar the Grouch (he's Orange!) and of course Kermit the Frog (this amazed my son, who only knew the green one through movies and "The Muppet Show" DVDs). The original multi-ethnic, friendly cast of humans are also all there, which included Gordon, Susan, Bob, Mr. Hooper, Luis and more. I love the ideal of hanging out with these folks! 

The shows are a treasure trove of '70s nostalgia. I love looking at the clothes including bell bottoms, flower shirts with huge collars and mini skirts. The actors (including the kids) all have either Vietnam-era long hair or those far-out afros. I also love the show's soundtrack, which makes ample use of both Jazz and '70s style Funk. Also, throughout the episodes are cameos from younger versions of Carol Burnett, Bill Cosby, Jackie Robinson, Lena Horne, James Earl Jones and the late, Johnny Cash.

The DVD boxset is made up of three discs, which contain the season premieres of the first 5 seasons. It interesting to see the show evolving and becoming more polished as time goes by. Also included are 45 bonus segments (including my favorite tunes "Rubber Duckie" and "Being Green"). The extras also include the original "pitch reel" use to sell the show to broadcasters. The DVD picture &amp; sound mastering is well done. I've seen a number of videotaped shows from that era, now appearing on DVD, that don't look half as good.

If I had but one complaint, it's about a warning thats put on the first disc, which says "these early Sesame Street episodes are intended for grownups and may not suit the needs of today's preschool children". Where did they get that from? My preschooler was absolutely engrossed in these episodes. He smiled and laughed as he counted and read along with the segments. One farm episode in particular got the two of us into a long conversation about milking cows (hey, its important to a 5 year old!).

This really is wonderful DVD boxset, which chronicles the early years of a show, that revolutionized children's television. It is both fun and entertaining. Hopefully, the fact, that there is a Volume 1 on the box means there is more to come! I highly recomend it for both nostalgic adults and their young children. Don't wait, just buy it

Rather than go with the traditional "box set-by-season" release schedule, the producers have taken the far more digestible and appealing approach of selecting highlight episodes from the show's first five seasons. This makes for a wonderful viewing experience for 30-somethings feeling nostalgic for their childhoods. To be honest, most people wouldn't want to sit through an entire season's worth, anyway. The "greatest hits"/"classic clips" approach is far more palatable.

While the Muppets are undeniably cute, this is a package that is squarely aimed at adults. There is an interesting disclaimer in the booklet as well as an animated introduction on disc 1 that explains how teaching methods have changed dramatically in the last 30 years, and that some components and ideas are no longer necessarily suitable for today's young audiences to watch on their own. For example, in the first episode, Gordon is walking alone with one of his newly-arrived young students after school and giving her a tour of Sesame Street. His wife invites the little girl to come over later for milk and cookies, and she accepts immediately. Her parents are nowhere to be seen, and are never consulted. In another episode, a little lost girl uses a dime to call home for help, but a well-meaning SuperGrover forcibly carries her away, ostensibly to save her mom the trip. And of course, there's the issue of the grownups not believing Big Bird even though he's telling the truth about the Snuffleupagus.

Disc 1 also contains the original 30 minute pitch reel that the Children's Television Workshop designed for Public Broadcasting Stations to consider the show. Introduced by CTW founding member Joyce Ganz Cooney, the reel features Rowlf the Dog explaining the show concept (creating "commercials" for letters and numbers) to Kermit by showing test clips and footage of development meetings. It's absolutely fascinating (and genuinely heart-warming) to see the people involved in pioneering what was an exciting and new learning medium. You see footage of a cartoon ("The Letter J") being pitched, developed, animated, recorded, and tested on kids. It's a remarkable process that makes you appreciate the hard work and true heart that goes into creating something positive for children. The footage interspersed with Muppet "producers" trying to come up with a name for this wonderful new show...

There are five episodes spread across three discs, one from each year between 1969-1974 (including the pilot). Each episode can be viewed as originally broadcast, or you can jump directly to a certain skit. The discs also contain separate sections that contain highlights from each season as a whole, so you can revisit hilarious classics like "Ernie Counts Sheep", "Grover's Restaurant", "Sesame Street News: Rapunzel", trippy cartoons like "Loaf of Bread, Container of Milk, and Stick of Butter", "Alligator King", "The Pinball Song", and great songs like "Bein' Green", "Rubber Duckie", "C Is For Cookie", and "I Love Trash".

There are also remarkable celebrity appearances, with Bill Cosby, Jackie Robinson, James Earl Jones, Lou Rawls and Carol Burnett counting or reciting the alphabet.

It's also interesting to see our favorite characters before they were fully developed: Big Bird is initially presented as an extraordinarily simple-minded goofy character and Oscar is a strange nuclear orange.

The booklet is packed full of information on the behind-the-scenes process and includes a mini-almanac  to help put things in perspective (when Sesame Street debuted, the average median income was less than $9000!). There's a mini-pullout puzzle section aimed at children, but I can't see too many kids actually bothering with it. Plus, the grownups won't want to tear up their booklet!

If you're feeling reflective and want to revisit pre-Elmo Sesame Street, this is an essential purchase that gives you the nostalgia fix you need without wearing out its welcome

I was born in 1961. I was born before Sesame St. in 1969. That's when the first time PBS had Sesame St. This before Embo or baby bear. I have watch it when my little sister Gail was born. I had the cookie moster pupput. I don't have any more. We also had LP record of Sesame St. This before the CD's came out.

It's about time these things went on DVD. The classic episodes are great. I don't have Noggin, so up until now I had to resort to YouTube to see them. I bought the DVDs to watch with my two-year old daughter - even though they don't have Elmo in them, she likes the other characters too. I might not show her the first episode (it's pretty trippy), but it was great watching how it all got started. The pitch film was very funny - it's a lot more like the Muppet Show, rather than Sesame Street. I hope they release a Vol. 2 soon

At 23 years of age, I can truly say that I have been a lifetime fan of Sesame Street. Watching the 3-DVD set of Sesame Street - Old School, Vol. 1 has been both nostalgic and enlightening. Because I was born practically a decade after most of the material on this set originally aired, I expected most of the content to be new to me (I was barely a year old when Mr. Hooper's death was explained to the world), but that was not the case. Many of the short films and interstitials were familiar (and not just because I used to watch Sesame Unpaved on Noggin) to me as a viewer from the mid-1980s, and I think that just underscores the quality the show has exhibited from the beginning. Sesame Street truly revolutionized children's programming, not just because it was educational, but because it was (and remains) entertaining, not pandering. I'll admit, seeing Gordon with an afro, Orange Oscar and the first few tries at Big Bird's head still freak me out a bit (as they did when I saw them on Noggin several years back), but the show itself is just as good as I ever remembered, something that cannot be said for most nostalgia entertainment (like Transformers or He-Man or JEM).

The set contains five full episodes from the first five seasons, and 54 (the liner notes are incorrect, they should have asked Count for help) bonus clips. The set also includes the 25 minute pitch-film that was made before the series originally aired, explaining Sesame Street's message and motive. Although the episodes have a disclaimer that it is not necessarily intended for today's pre-school children, I believe they would probably enjoy "classic" Street even more than the current lineup of shows. The fact that today's pre-schoolers may be more advanced than the Sesame Street of yore can really be attributed to Sesame Street itself, and that's pretty cool. Still, I personally appreciate that the aim of the set is at adults, because so many of us associate our childhood with Sesame Street. A booklet is included that gives a brief overview of the series from the first five years and I found it informative. 

According to Muppet Central, a few sketches were altered or removed for music copyright issues (one with Stevie Wonder, one with Rogers &amp; Hammerstein), but because I never saw the originals, I found nothing amiss. What astounded me more than anything was that at the end of the first five years, more than 600 episodes of the show had been produced. No wonder they can't release full seasons! Although the full-length episodes are great, my favorite part are the additional sketches from each respective season. Seeing Kermit sing "Bein' Green" in its original form, the "Bread, Milk and Butter" cartoon and the "In in the Sky with Diamonds" parody is a real treat.

The picture quality is great -- especially considering the program's age (and the fact that it was one of the first programs to be recorded on video, although film was used for most of the interstitials) -- I doubt the show ever looked as good as it looks right now. The sound quality is good too -- mono of course -- but clear and crisp.

Overall, I highly recommend this set for anyone who loves or loved Sesame Street. For those who were born after these episodes aired (like me), looking back at the beginning is really special. It is clear that everyone involved had a true love for teaching and interacting with children and taking television to another level

I was SO. EXCITED. for this release when I heard about it. I ran right over and pre-purchased it and waited with bated breath for it to arrive.

When I put it in to watch it, well, I was a little sad. I had somehow convinced myself that I was getting ALL the episodes for the seasons, which is silly given that it was 5x a week. But still, you can't reverse yourself once you get an idea like that in your head, so color me disappointed.

TBS, what is included is great. I'm sad to say DD is unimpressed, but that's because she's jaded. I'll work on her. They note at the start that it's for adults and not "today's preschoolers" which is odd to me. It's Sesame Street! It's always been for preschoolers. Are ours somehow more advanced than we were??

So glad I ordered early!! My tape just arrived and I can't believe it.  I've already owned the first dvd and this isn't even comparable.  This dvd has much more instruction and goes form the lowest levels for litte children up to breakin and advanced steps.  The crew is much better and this was clearly directed for learning as well as a fun watch. It's worth every penny!!!

I found this movie to be amazing.  You really connected with the characters.  This is the type of movie that you either hate it or you love it.  I for one loved it.   The scene with Lee Grant screaming at the end is a tear jerker.   I've seen this movie numberous times and still cry during that scene.  I love the closeness he had with his friends and the distance he had with his father.  It was very similar to my family and friends.  If you like emotional movies,  buy it.  If your not into the sappy movies,  don't buy it.

Waste of money.  Waste of time.  Well-known cast.  Amateurish direction.  Plotless.  Politically correct to the point of being stupid.  The film's incessant attempts at humor fail.  Eric Roberts' character laughs-off his grave circumstance throughout most of the film.  He is self-important, Godless and emotionally false.  It's difficult to empathize with such an unrealisitic character.  The best performances in this film were given by Gregory Harrison and Lee Grant.  The best scene is Gregory Harrison and Eric Roberts' passionate farewell kiss.  Most authentic moment in the film: Lee Grant's reaction to her dying son being carried off.  Very difficult to watch through in one-sitting because it's so repetitive and vapid. You will wait and wait for something to happen and nothing ever does until the final moments.  If you choose to waste your time with this film, you'll be sorry you did

A brilliant, but sad movie about the effects of AIDS, both to the patient, and to the family and friends.  Eric Roberts, Gregory Harrison, and the rest of the all-star cast were phenomenal.  For those who have lost loved ones and friends to this horrific disease, you will definitely be moved to the point of tears, then laughter, then tears again.  I thought this was definitely Oscar material.  It is right up there with "Philadelphia" in my book

This movie is my all time favorite movie.  The cast is awesome, you really feel the pain and anguish in Amalia (played by Lee Grant) as she struggles to deal with the last day of her son's life.  This movie reminds you that its important to never leave issues with others unresolved.  I love the way that Randal Kleiser was able to throw humor into a not so humorous situation and not come across as heartless.  The movie at times feels a little forced but I can't think of how you can tackle this topic in under two hours.

This has to be one of the most moving films I have seen!  The story involves a man infected with HIV (back in the early days), who decides to end his life when he is diagnosed with AIDS.  The character decides to say goodbye to all the special people in his life by throwing a party.  This movie will make you laugh and cry at several points throught.  As everyone has said, watch it with someone and have lots of kleenex handy

This movie will make you laugh and cry with a who's who of hollywood.  The music alone will move you to the kleenex box.  If you have lost someone to aids, this movie will touch you deeply.  I was told not to watch this movie alone.  Watch it with someone to hug.  How right they were.  Bronson Pinchot playing comic relief was a stereotype of the obnoxious friend a lot of us have.  Eric Roberts and Gregory Harrison have a chemistry eerily familiar to many gay couples I know.  Bravo!  Get the soundtrack too for those rainy days when you just want to reflect

A must see for not only anime lovers but anyone who enjoys beautiful scenic frames and the classic theme of good versus evil. Personally, I liked it better than "Spirited Away"

I'm not sure what it is about Miyazaki films but for some reason a 21 year old here feels like an 8 year old again.  I'm not saying this movie is just for kids or anything but I would highly recommend the movie for any parents out there.  Now I went and watched the movie without knowing anything about it and sure i was a bit unsure of the movie at first but Miyazaki won out in the end.

Technically the movie is pretty good, the voice overs are pretty decent.  If you are one of those people that couldn't stand say dakota fanning and her sister in "My Neighbor Totorro" you have nothing to worry about.  I got to give props to Billy Crystal, he does a great job.

I really don't know what else to tell you, by now you should just buy it already especially if you are already a Miyazaki fan.  If not this one would be a great one to see first.  I'd also recommend Princess Mononoke and Kiki's Delivery Service

Let me say right away that I enjoyed and appreciated the elements of "Steam Punk" in this film. People who enjoyed "Steam Boy", Neal Stephenson's "The Diamond Age", "The Difference Engine" by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, "The Vision of Escaflowne" anim� series, some of the aspects of the "Warcraft" universe and the Australian award winning animated film "The Mysterious Geographical Adventures of Jasper Morello" will enjoy the general "Steam Punk" feel of Howl's Moving Castle.

The story of Sophie is very engaging and beguiling. Howl, to some extent, is a side interest in this film, but then, the men always are in Miyazaki films. It is the power and minds of the women which fascinate Miyazaki, not the men.

Miyazaki IS the ultimate feminist film maker. Who else would make a film where the central character is a little old lady?

I can't wait for "Tales From Earthsea" and the new Miyazaki film!

For the most part you already know the story from reading the rest of the reviews and summaries.  
Someone referred to this as commercial animation and not your traditional animation you would get from Miyazaki and Co. 

I disagree.  Since when has life been simple to just show us or lead us to believe that if you are in love nothing else goes on in the world?  
To those that are in love I'm sure nothing else would matter.  The war itself in this film is almost synonymous with Howl's irresponsibility.  The fact that they have chosen to fight without chance of talks and without regard of life from either side is highly irresponsible.
In the end Howl learns to not run away and to stand forth.  Such is when he is vulnerable but willing to take a chance at giving his heart to someone else.  To Sophie.  And in the end give chance to make the rest of the world right.

I can't think of any other films that really make me feel as much as I do when I watch Miyazaki's films.

Howl is no exception.  The amazing visuals, the colours, the vibrance, the characters are always memorable, and you fall in love with them always even the bad ones.  And the music!  You feel as though you are indeed a part of this world and trying hard not to fall out of your seat.
  

Though the english cast is all star, I myself prefer the Japanese voice actors as they're voices sound great, regardless if you can't understand them.  I do believe Billy Crystal was miscast as Calcifer.  Watch it with subs first then turn on the dubs.  You'll know what I mean.  But for the rest, Sophie has a soft, sweet, and beautiful voice, Lauren Bacall plays a wonderfully malicious Witch of the Waste, and Christian Bale plays a decent Howl, though for the mannerisms and dialogue I would expect someone younger to voice him.

All in all, it's definitely one of his top films, and possibly my favourite.  I still love Chihiro just as much, same with Mononoke, but this will always be sitting right next them in terms of beauty, artistry, and story.  Howl's Moving Castle is indeed, quite moving

80-76%-perfect
75-71%-awsome
70-66%-good
65-61%-poor
60-56%-awful

1. THE HART FOUNDATION vs THE BRITISH BULLDOGS (July-13, 1985): Emanating from Madison Square Garden, this isn't what you would call a classic bout between these 2 great teams, but it is a nice little preview of what they are capable of. The dynamic between the 4 men is perfect, with the Bulldogs struggling to contain the constant double-team maneuvers of their opponents, as well as the strength of The Anvil. DaveyBoy Smith plays the face in peril for most of the match, while the Harts (including Jimmy on the outside with his megaphone) do everything to keep Smith in the ring. I've seen better hot tags to Dynamite (where were the suplexes?), while the action here wasn't as crisp as these guys would usually be. Still a great match, despite the disappointing draw result being called as the MSG curfew came up at the 13 minute mark. These guys easily had an extra 20 minutes in them, if not a lot more. WInners No contest. Match Rating 7.5/10.

2. THE HART FOUNDATION vs THE KILLER BEES (February-17, 1986-Initially, the structure of this match is actually quite a bit different to most Hart Foundation bouts, as The Killer Bees target &amp; isolate Neidhart for the first 4 minutes. There's some very good tag-team action here &amp; it gets the crowd very much involved. Soon though, the Harts get on top &amp; take control of Brunzell for what seems like an eternity. It's a little too long for my liking &amp; there are a few too many restholds. Although, it doesn't seem to bore the live crowd in attendance, as they frantically anticipate the hot tag to Blair. It eventually comes &amp; it's an understatement to say that the action picks up from there. Blair does everything but get the 3 count as the entertainment picks up tremendously. It was worth the wait &amp; I have to conclude that this was a very good match at the end of the day. This was despite the disappointing time limit draw result, even though I had the duration as 19 minutes (not 20. Winners it is a draw. Match Rating 8/10.

3.  BRET HART vs RICKY `THE DRAGON' STEAMBOAT (March-8, 1986): Emanating from Boston Garden, this is an early singles match for the Hitman which took place just prior to WrestleMania 2. In true heel form, Bret attacks Steamboat as the bell rings &amp; gets the early advantage. But it doesn't last too long, as the tremendously over Dragon takes control rather quickly. Ricky actually is the one to slow the pace down as he targets the left arm of Bret. But here &amp; there, especially when or the other is running the ropes, these 2 show the flashes of brilliance (&amp; crispness) that we know they are capable of. As the match settles in, there is some nice back &amp; forth action, with Hart probably having the better of the offense (to the surprise of the fans). A referee bump towards the end leads to a short closing sequence where Steamboat reverses a pinning attempt &amp; gets the victory at the 15 minute mark. The potential was there to see here as Bret showed great ability to wrestle a 15 minute match all by his lonesome against an over face. Isolated though, you know these 2 could do a lot better as the pace was initially a little too methodical &amp; the bout didn't play up to Steamboat's strengths sufficiently. Winner RICKY `THE DRAGON' STEAMBOAT. Match Rating 8.5/10.

4. BRET HART vs `THE MILLION DOLLAR MAN' TED DIBIASE (March-8, 1989- Emanating from Odessa-Texas, this match took place after Bret had turned face &amp; started wearing the pink &amp; black. It should also be noted that there is no commentary during this bout. Bret gets the explosive start &amp; attacks Dibiase as the bell rings, almost sneaking the victory once or twice. Quite entertaining to begin with as the Hitman seemingly has an answer for everything the Million Dollar Man throws at him. But a missed charge by Hart results in him getting winded &amp; Dibiase taking control for minutes on end with his interesting mix of strength &amp; technical wrestling that became his trademark in the late 80's &amp; early 90's (although I personally preferred the slimmer &amp; more athletic Dibiase of the early 80's from what I have seen). Back &amp; forth from that point onwards, with each man attempting to outdo the other while attempting numerous pinfalls. Despite Dibiase apparently being blown out (his heavy breathing is evident), these 2 somehow stretch the match out to a 16 minute duration, with Bret's superior athleticism helping the match quality out the longer it progresses. This bout that ends in a double countout, is well put together, if not anything super special. Winner double count out. MAtch Rating 8/10.

5. THE HART FOUNDATION vs THE ROCKERS (April-28, 1990-From an episode of `Saturday Nights Main Event', this is a non-stop back &amp; forth entertaining match that simply never lets up from the opening bell. It proves the adaptability of The Hart Foundation &amp; the potential of The Rockers. These 4 guys just go at it at a blistering pace. Hart &amp; Michaels get a good deal of the action which obviously helps, but even Jannetty &amp; Neidhart keep the action moving along at a great pace. Terrific stuff &amp; not completely ruined by the Double DQ result at only the 9 minute mark, when Demolition run in &amp; turn it into a 3 team brawl. WInner double dq. match RAting 8.5/10. 

6. THE HART FOUNDATION vs THE NASTY BOYS (WrestleMania 7. March-24, 1991): The Hart Foundation came into this bout as the tag champs &amp; without the management of Jimmy Hart, who had since moved over to manage Knobbs &amp; Saggs (or Saggy Knob as I used to call them). I must admit that I was never a fan of The Nasty Boys. In fact, they pretty much constantly bored me. Just to prove it, they make Neidhart look like a quick technician here! Thankfully, this is quite well booked in that it uses Bret a lot &amp; he pretty much carries the bout. Of course, he (&amp; we) have to put up with the boring Nasty Boys offense in the meantime &amp; that brings the match down a peg or 5! The hot tag is eventually made to Neidhart who cleans house. But in a flurry of activity, the Nastys use Jimmy's megaphone &amp; escape with the title win after 12 minutes. Not great, but could have been so much worse. Well booked &amp; sufficiently entertaining. Winners and new wwe tag team champs THE NASTY BOYS. match Rating 7.5/10.

7. BRET HART vs `MR PERFECT' CURT HENNIG (SummerSlam. August-26, 1991):  Great start to this match for Perfect's InterContinental Title, with some crisp &amp; entertaining sequences of one-upmanship. Bret's mentioning of Hennig's back injury &amp; those first few moments show what might have been if Hennig had stayed injury-free (both then &amp; in later years)... Especially when Bret was on the top of his game as WWE Champion. That's not to say that they didn't deliver here, as they well &amp; truly did. Just (pardon the pun) perfectly put together, as these 2 guys showed that you could have a great 15+ minute technical match. Great storytelling throughout as both men tried to outdo each other, leading to many exciting nearfalls &amp; some great unpredictability. Bret kicked out of the PerfectPlex (which was surprising at the time) &amp; went to work on Hennig. But to go with the flow of the entire bout, Perfect fought hard &amp; kicked out of many 2 counts. The SharpShooter eventually got the job done though (if a little too quickly &amp; anti-climactically) to win the InterContinental Title at the 18 minute mark. Great stuff from these 2 terrific wrestlers, although I'm certain that if timing &amp; injury permitted, they could do even better. Winner and new wwe itc champ bret hart. Match Rating 9/10.

8. BRET HART vs `THE BRITISH BULLDOG' DAVEY BOY SMITH (SummerSlam. August-29, 1992 From the SummerSlam that was held in England, this is my favorite match ever. It was very disappointing to see that DaveyBoy Smith's hugely atmospheric ring entrance in front of his home crowd has been edited out of this DVD! Bret enters this main-event match as the InterContinental Champion. The British crowd are rather amazing, and make me wonder why we haven't seen another ppv outside of North America since. Just the perfect mix of everything, these 2 put together an excellent combination of technical, power &amp; psychological wrestling. This is arguably the bout that elevated Hart to main-event status &amp; gave DaveyBoy Smith a significant push. 26 minutes in length &amp; the final 7 or so is better than anything you will ever see. I think Bobby `The Brain' Heenan best summed this up on commentary when he stated "Is there anything they haven't done?" Winner Bret Hart. Match Rating 10/10.

9. BRET HART vs BAM BAM BIGELOW (April-24, 1993 This match is from a live event held in Barcelona-Spain &amp; comes complete with Spanish commentary (I like the sound of the word "Phenomo" &amp; the way they roll their "r's"). Bam Bam's priceless mix of strength &amp; athleticism usually works very well with smaller wrestlers, but I'm not 100% certain that technical wrestling is his forte. For the first 8-10 minutes of this bout, he practically dominates &amp; targets Bret's back. But it's way too methodically paced &amp; only works in batches. A missed headbutt from the top rope gives Bret the chance to quicken the pace, while Bam Bam continues to work on the back. The bout is much more successful at this stage, but ends too quickly at just the 12 minute mark with the Hitman nicely rolling Bam Bam up with a victory roll from a headscissors position for the win. Winner bret Hart/ Match Rating 7.5/10.

10. BRET HART vs `MR PERFECT' CURT HENNIG (King Of The Ring. June-13, 1993): This was the semi-final match of the annual tournament &amp; the 2nd of 3 bouts that Bret wrestled on the night. The first couple of minutes of this match is almost identical to their SummerSlam '91 bout, and that's not necessarily a bad thing! This isn't entirely a duplicate of the match from approximately 2 years earlier though, as Hennig controls this bout a little more. Plus, he had obviously since learnt the art of the knife-edge chop from Ric Flair, as he uses it a fair bit. Being picky, the structure &amp; psychology of this bout doesn't quite work, as Bret hurts his knee on the outside &amp; looks in all sorts of trouble. But then, only a couple of minutes later, he is on the offense &amp; working on Hennig's legs! When it finally evens out, Perfect goes for a couple of sleeper-holds, which makes sense for him to recover from his sore leg, but doesn't exactly increase the entertainment aspect of this bout! Then, out of nowhere at the 17 minute mark, Hennig starts to attack Bret's injured hand (from his first match that night)! A great suplex counter to the outside gets the crowd on their feet, and it's quickly followed up by a roll-up reversal at the 19 minute mark to give the victory to Bret. Still a very good match, but wasn't quite right storytelling &amp; psychology-wise. Sufficiently different from their 1991 match, but not as good. Winner bret hart. match Rating 8.5/10.

11. BRET HART vs OWEN HART (WrestleMania 10. March-20, 1994
This was a strange feeling as we basically had a main-event opening a huge pay-per-view. Similarly to the match against The British Bulldog, there was a nice family storyline build-up here, although it was probably stronger in this match, as Bret &amp; Owen weren't both faces &amp; the WWE really spent some time on this feud. Throughout this bout, there was a constant game of one-upmanship (especially on Owen's behalf) that was just so entertaining to watch. In fact, it was so good that you almost couldn't help cheer for some of Owen's bigger moves during the match. They wisely didn't go all out from the very beginning, instead choosing to gradually build up the pace and, for that matter the spots as well, as the match progressed. 

A turning point occurs at the 13 minute mark when Bret hurts his knee on a dive to the outside. Owen perfectly targets it &amp; fortunately keeps the moves (whether for impact or submission) coming at a good pace, rather than slowing the pace down. Nor does it take too long for Bret to make the comeback with a great variety of offense. A nice closing sequence sees a battle of SharpShooters followed by Owen's unpredictable pinfall counter to a victory roll at the 20 minute mark. It's a match that probably doesn't scream out 10 out of 10 to some, but when all is considered (the feud, the storyline, the psychology, the crispness, the pacing, the structure, the entertainment &amp; the unpredictability), it's hard to rate it anything else. Both men come out of this match looking supremely good. Winner Owen Hart. Match Rating 10/10.
                           Disk 3
12. BRET HART vs OWEN HART (September-29, 1994 This match from White Plains - New York was televised on some show called `The Action Zone'. It was for Bret's WWE Championship &amp; took place after their cage match at SummerSlam (not on this DVD). Doesn't quite have the same impact as their WrestleMania 10 bout (or the cage match for that matter), but it still has some great crisp action, terrific counters &amp; reversals and good overall entertainment value. Two edits due to commercial breaks definitely don't help the flow of the bout, but we still get to see 14 minutes of very good footage. Jim `The Anvil' Neidhart gets involved on behalf of Owen, but DaveyBoy Smith negates him &amp; eventually pushes Owen off the top rope to enable Bret to get the pinfall win. Hard to rate as it it's a television match that obviously doesn't stack up to the WrestleMania 10 or SummerSlam bouts, but it's still very solid &amp; definitely a good watch. Winner Bret Hart. Match Rating 8/10.

13. BRET HART vs HAKUSHI (In Your House. May-14, 1995 This was the first of 2 matches on the same night for Bret, as he was to face Jerry `The King' Lawler later on. Hakushi was a pretty good &amp; very athletic Japanese wrestler that the WWE brought in for about a year. Following a couple of early communication breakdowns that resulted in some messy looking wrestling, these 2 settled into a rather nice pace. I'm unsure that the bout made great use of Hakushi's unorthodox offense, although we do see a nice Asai Moonsault &amp; a couple of other very athletic moves. Not the perfect structure either as I would have preferred more back &amp; forth action. I may be a little nit-picky though, as this was still a rather entertaining match, especially towards the end when both men worked very hard to win the fans over. The Hitman gets the win with a victory roll at the 14 minute mark. It actually felt longer than that, which is usually not a good sign, but this was still pretty good. Winner Bret Hart. Match Rating 8/10.

14. BRET HART vs KEVIN `DIESEL' NASH (Survivor Series. November-19, 1995): This was a `No Disqualification' match for Diesel's WWE Championship (which he had held for 51 weeks!). The bout starts off predictably with Nash using his superior size &amp; strength to overpower The Hitman. In fact, Bret spends basically the first 8 minutes running away from Diesel on the outside... very unsuccessfully, I might add! Bret turns the tide with some biting &amp; eye gouging (yep, you read that correctly), and then predictably targets the big mans leg with precision offense. Obviously, this slows the pace of the bout down a little, but not so much that the match ever becomes boring. Bret then has the interesting idea of using a microphone cable to tie Diesel's ankle to the steel ringpost. This leads to multiple chairshots to seemingly have the big man out for the count. But Nash eventually creates enough separation to enable him to untie himself &amp; subsequently use that same cable to choke Bret. What follows is some decent, if awkward (due to over-selling), back &amp; forth action, highlighted by Hart going through the Spanish Announce Table in a rather simple, yet very effective, spot. A little unbelievably, Bret rolls up Diesel soon after to get the pinfall victory at the 25 minute mark to win the title. Different type of `No DQ' match that provides good variation &amp; is quite entertaining. But it doesn't match up to the April '96 `No DQ' match that Diesel had with Shawn Michaels. Winner and new wwe champ bret hart. Match Rating 8.5/10.

15. BRET HART vs 'THE BRITISH BULLDOG' DAVEY BOY SMITH (In Your House. December-17, 1995 This match was for Bret's WWE Championship &amp; DaveyBoy Smith had recently turned heel &amp; was managed by Jim Cornette. It should also be noted that Bret's sister Diana, who was married to the Bulldog, accompanied Smith to the ring. Nice beginning to this bout, but the Bulldog then drags it down with resthold after resthold. It's not until about the 9 minute mark that Bret thankfully gets in any great sequence of offense (including a nice piledriver). But DaveyBoy regains control after countering a superplex &amp; attacking Hart on the outside (including busting him wide open). Back in the ring, the Bulldog gets multiple 2 counts with a piledriver, a vertical suplex, a press slam &amp; a diving headbutt. He even throws in a Bow `N' Arrow for good measure! What follows is some good back &amp; forth action that is entertaining, despite being a little imperfect &amp; not quite meshing successfully. DaveyBoy does hit a nice running powerslam on the outside, but back in the ring he falls victim to a superplex, which leads into many good nearfalls. Bret eventually gets the victory at the 21 minute mark with a rollup (he won a few too many of his big bouts that way!). There are flaws in this match &amp; it doesn't compare too well to their SummerSlam '92 bout. But these 2 eventually work so hard here that they win you over. Winner and sdtill wwe champ bret hart. Match Rating 8/10.

16. BRET HART vs `STONE COLD' STEVE AUSTIN (WrestleMania 13. March-23, 1997): This was called a `Submissions Match' which basically meant that you had to win by submission. It also had a 'No Disqualificaion' stipulation attached to it. Making his WWE debut as the referee here was former UFC Champion Ken Shamrock. This was a great feud that began when Stone Cold called out Bret while he was away from the WWE. This resulted in a very good bout at Survivor Series '96 &amp; Austin subsequently cheating Hart out of a Royal Rumble win. Hart began the match as a face &amp; Austin as a heel, but come the end of the bout, the tables would be turned as this was one of the best booked matches of all time! 

These 2 are at it before the bell &amp; the intensity is top notch. It doesn't take too long before they are into the crowd &amp; the last thing on their mind out there is a submission hold! Following a couple of spots involving the steel ring steps, the combatants are back into the ring at the 6 minute mark, at which time Bret precisely targets Austin's knee. A Stone Cold Stunner out of nowhere stems the tide, but Bret everually regains control with a ringpost figure 4 leglock. Back &amp; forth it goes as Stone Cold gets back on top with a couple of chairshots. This leads to the first attempted submission hold at the 12 minute mark, as Austin goes for a strange looking armbar followed by a Boston Crab. Back on the outside, Austin gets Irish Whipped into the steel guardrail &amp; is busted wide open. Bret then attacks the forehead wound, before heading back to the knee. Despite all this, 'Stone Cold' gets a second wind &amp; puts together some intense offense, before trying to choke the Hitman with an extension cord. But the nearby ringbell saves Bret &amp; he quickly follows up with the SharpShooter. After almost 2 minutes of struggling to fight out of it, a bloodied Austin passes out &amp; referee Shamrock calls for the bell. 

Any questions as to whether this is a 10 out of 10 match is almost negated by that infamous perfect shot of Austin having blood dripping down his face while attempting to struggle out of the SharpShooter. But it wasn't just the ending that was perfectly booked, it was almost the entire bout. The heated feud really came through, the action was intense, entertaining &amp; rather original, plus a tremendous story was told. If anything, it could have lasted a little longer than the 22 minutes that it did, while it also could have possibly had a little more technical wrestling involved considering the participants. But that is very much nitpicking, I can assure you. Winner Bret Hart. Match Rating 10/10.

17. BRET HART vs THE UNDERTAKER (One Night Only. September-20, 1997 This ppv was actually a bit of an experiment, as it emanated from Birmingham-England &amp; the partially split crowd actually made the bout quite interesting. It was fairly similarly structured to the SummerSlam match which happened a month earlier, but the big difference was that the earlier bout had Shawn Michaels as the Special Guest Referee. Thus, this match lacked a little unpredictability, plus HBK's entertaining antics, in comparison. The bout was natural &amp; solid, but over-long. It began with some nice intense moves that were full of impact. The psychology of the bout was ok, as 'Taker targetted the chest of the Hitman with both blows &amp; submission moves. In response, Bret predictably targets the phenom's legs. This slows the pace down a fair bit, although the action is sufficiently constant. Towards the end, there are a couple of nice counters to the opponent's finishers. But it all goes on for too long, as Bret retains the title at the 29 minute mark after he gets his neck caught between the middle &amp; top ropes, and the referee disqualifies The Undertaker for continuing to attack him. A disappointing ending to a solid match. Winner by dq Bret Hart. Match Rating 8/10.

18. BRET HART vs CHRIS BENOIT (WCW Monday Nitro. October-4, 1999 This was the Owen Hart Tribute Match that took place at the same arena in which Bret's brother lost his life. This bout is almost surreal &amp; it really does take a lot of time to both the viewing &amp; live audience to get into it. Because of this, I believe that Benoit &amp; Hart opened the bout with more of a clinic, than a match. They are very technical &amp; very respectful for the first 5 or so minutes. In fact, the first half of it's 23 minute duration (excluding commercial breaks) is a little meandering, but technically proficient. But it's just too difficult to ignore the crispness of the performed moves, as it is superb. It's also great to see Benoit pull out a couple of moves here &amp; there that he doesn't do anymore (post neck surgery). From about the 10 minute mark onwards, we see some great counter &amp; chain wrestling, as you would expect from these two. And they're both very professional, as the competition aspect of the match does come into play very well. A tough one to rate because of the match circumstances, but definitely very good, despite the strange psychology &amp; lack of a cracking pace. Winner Bret Hart. Match Rating 8.5/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give bret harts dvd a grade of 152.5/180 which is a 85 % which is my higest garde ever which means you need to get this dvd. Great dvd pick this up as soon as u cna. If u could tell me if my review was helpful or  not i would appreicate that. Thanks for your time.

As a Hitman fan growing up I was very excited for this release. It did not disappoint at all! Its a disc that you can watch over and over since there is just so much that he accomplished in his career. 

Bret was more or less bitter about a lot of things and people in the last few years but he had the class to focus on his career and not on petty grudges. He even goes on to praise Flair for being a great worker even though he had no love for the nature boy. He did not speak ill of Shawn or Vince - and did not want to make Montreal the focus, which I think to many Hitman fans we are very glad! He wanted to show us his career rather than his opinions and that alone deserved a 5 star in my book.

I would like to say a few things regarding other reviews here.
-Bret did not want Shawn on his DVD - this is simply not true - I read a Bret interview where he said he wanted the iron match but that would mean he had to take off 2-3 other matches and since it was on WM set he decided not to. So please stop with the "he cant accept Shawn" theory.

-Second thing is how others did not comment on this disc. WWE already made SCREWED: the Bret Hart Story and Bret watched it. I would assume he was hurt by a few people's comments on it - Hogan, Flair, Lawler, among others. Also I would assume none of the parties involved wanted to switch face and praise him. Plus he did about 7 hours of footage and edited down to 2 hours. I am disappointed not to hear more from his peers but most of that generation does not work for WWE and/or had fallouts with Vince.

-Lastly- for those who want to include the "Screwjob". Honestly there is no reason to consider it. It wasnt the best match between the two and the "WWE Ending" was the ringing of the bell and Shawn running out of the ring. I dont know what you people hope to see but that 30 second ending isnt really worth it. They do not show him breaking monitors or punching vince.

I felt his match collection was but it did not including anything from his Lawler, Backlund, Yoko feuds. And the whole series of events with Austin couldve been included in more detail as it was so much fun to watch! The matches selected showed how good of a wrestler he is - and NO he does not finish them all off with his finishing move (unlike a lot of others who have DVDs out)! 

I surely hope WWE can someday release a second set of Bret Hart matches similiar to what they did for the Undertaker. He def have 3 more dvd full of great matches! In the meantime I will be enjoying the collection and relive the memories of Bret the Hitman Hart

The absolute best is Hitman Hart:  Wrestling With Shadows.  However, if you want the newest interviews with Bret along with some of the best footage you can see of him from his early Stampede days to WCW, this is the DVD to get!  I'm so glad to finally have some excellent matches of his on DVD.  My only complaint was the audio on the Hart vs. Austin match for Wrestlemania 13 is off by about 2 seconds which doesn't sound like much but is very noticeable when someone hits the mat and there's no sound until a few seconds later.  But it's not enough to drop it down to 4 stars.  

The tributes to his brothers Owen and Dean as well as other fallen commrades including brother in law Davey Boy Smith, Curt Hennig, Big Boss Man, Rick Rude, Miss Elizabeth and others were touching.

They did an excellent job with this DVD despite the fact McMahon had to give a BS statement at the beginning about Bret 
"putting their differences aside" for the sake of the DVD.  It was very obviously another dig by an unscrupulous shyster.

If you're looking for the "Montreal Screwjob" match in its entirety on this DVD, you won't find it.  It was cut for time (and Bret said he wanted to "de-emphasize" it on this project) but is featured in bits and pieces in the documentary itself.  Thankfully Bret hocking on McMahon was shown several times which made me smile after the opening statement by McMahon.

Highly recommended

   This is a great set if you are interested in knowing Bret "Hitman" Hart the man.  However, the matches leave much to be desired.  It seems that Bret focused more on choosing matches that were sentimental to him as opposed to what would be most memorable to fans.  Overall, I would still recommend this set because it is a first rate documentary.  However, if you want more wrestling and less documentary, you might want to spring for the Undertaker DVD

This three disc set is a must-have for any wrestling fan. The first disc does a great job of telling the story of how he became the hitman and covers the controversy in montreal which forced him to leave wwe as well as his look back on the tragic passing of his brother Owen. The other two discs include most of the hitman's best matches. His match with HBK from wrestlemania 12 was left out probably because bret wanted it left out and maybe since it was a very long match. Some of the matches included are: WM 13 submission match vs. Austin, WM 10 vs. Owen, and his Summerslam '92 match against the British Bulldog. This is a great dvd set that does well with capturing the true essence of why Bret Hart was the Excellence of Execution. I believe this set includes a total of 18 hitman matches which were not only singles matches but also his matches from earlier in his career in tag team action along with Jim the Anvil Niedhart in the Hart Foundation. So this set is just great simply because it is comprehensive in its coverage of Bret's career from early wwe to his days in WCW. Buy this dvd set. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED

The greatest wrestler to have ever graced a squared circle finally gets to shed light on his legacy.  Ever since Survivor Series '97...Bret Hart's career hasn't been labeled with the words "Excellence Of Execution" but with the word "SCREWED" and it's stayed that way for over close to 10 years and would have been kept that way for the rest of his life after the original annoucement that this DVD would be labeled "Screwed: The Bret Hart Story." However, Bret stepped up &amp; was able to erase that word from his legacy is replace it with "Best There Is, Best There Was, Best There Ever Will Be" and also made this one of the most "unique" DVD sets in WWE history.

The early years of Bret growing up in the Hart household and breaking into his dad's Stampeed Wrestling kick the documentry off.  His entrance in to WWE and not really getting off to a good start (Cowboy Bret Hart?) until he finally teamed with Jim Neidhart &amp; Jimmy Hart to form the Hart Foundation.  The Hart Foundation's dominance over the tag team division as well as Bret's ability to be a heel are glossed over before his road to the Intercontinental Championship and how important that championship was to his career (which is amazing compared to how it's being used in WWE today).  His classic matches featuring Roddy Piper (WrestleMania VIII &amp; my favorite "Hitman" match), Mr. Perfect &amp; British Bulldog (SummerSlam '91 &amp; '92) are also looked upon leading up to his first WWE title reign (including highlights from the match with Flair that is rare to find), the impact is had on making him an international superstar, and how he was able to make to have people apprechate wrestling more over than Hulk Hogan's sports entertainment.  His fued with his brother Owen is discussed after Bret discusses his disappointment in how his first title reign ended (remember Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania IX?) and how he worked his way back to the title including the King Of The Ring tournament.  His disapointment in his third title reign being completely overlooked infavor of Shawn Michaels leading up to his WrestleMania XII Ironman Match.  The Ironman match is heavily discussed as Bret talks about how he thought everything (promos, commentary during the match) were in favor of HBK.  His return to WWE after his vacation and the heated fued between himself &amp; Stone Cold Steve Austin is heavily discussed as well as the respect for one another.  Bret's last run which provoked a U.S.A. vs. Canada fued along with the new Hart Foundation is discussed leading up to the Survivor Series.  Survivor Series isn't heavily talked about but you get everyone's feelings now after they've had plently of times to reflect on their actions.  Bret's disappointing run in WCW is discussed along with Bret's favorite moments including the Owen Hart tribute match.  The profile on Bret rounds out with him talking about his stroke and how his life has been for the past few years.

DVD extras include interview outtakes where Bret discusses certain issues like the name "The Dungeon", how Konnan taught Bret the Sharpshooter, a funny Owen story where he crankcalled Stu Hart, the story behind his sunglasses, and the whole Hart Family tree.  Also Bret pays tribute to his friends in the wrestling business who passed away along with his late brother Dean Hart.  Hidden extras were his "You Start The Fire" music video, an old Stampeed Wrestling interview featuring the Bushwackers (then known as the Sheepherders), and interview outtakes feauturing Bret discussing never injuring another wrestler, and where he got the name "Hitman."

Earlier I said this was the most unique DVD set in WWE history and that's because instead of following the usual pattern of putting high profile matches (title wins, most memorable matches), Bret picked out his personal favorite matches and most of which are rare and most people didn't know happened or were so low profile that people forget they happened.  These type of matches feature Ricky Steamboat, Bam Bam Bigelow, Ted Dibiase, Hakushi, Owen Hart, Undertaker and matches as the Hart Foundation against British Bulldogs, Killer Beez, and The Rockers.  Alot of Bret's PPV &amp; high profile matches are included featuring himself as the Tag Team Champions The Hart Foundation against Nasty Boys (WrestleMania VII), two matches against Mr. Perfect (King Of The Ring '93) including his first Intercontinental Title win (SummerSlam '91), his WrestleMania X match against Owen Hart, his No Holds Barred match against WWE Champion Diesel (Survivor Series '95 &amp; the only World Title win on his DVD), British Bulldog (In Your House), the Submission Match from WrestleMania 13 against Steve Austin (the audio is off by at least a second), and the Owen Hart tribute match from WCW Nitro against Chris Benoit.

Overall, this is probably one of the best DVD sets that WWE has put out &amp; is a fitting tribute to Bret "The Hitman" Hart.

This dvd in my opinion is by far the best bio dvd done so far. The program part which runs around for a little more than 2 hrs is excellent. The eighteen matches that are on here are excellent. Its just a very well done and well deserved dvd to one of the greatest wrestlers of all time. I think they should have one more dvd cause there is more than enough great matches that didnt make this dvd. Here's what it should look like. Also according to articles ive read Bret recorded more than 7 hrs in interviews and only about 2 and half made the 1st dvd im not saying they have another documentary just some extra interview on the extras part of the dvd.

The thing that gets me about Bret Everytime is his Sincerity. 
He always has and always will be a LOVER OF THE SPORT. 
More than anything else this set delivers, and it delivers all you could want, except maybe Bret beating down on Vince (just a personal fantasy) And you ALMOST get that too! 
But more than anything - you get tons of good solid, straight up talk from a man who dedicated himself to entertaining a public with something he loved - and was born and raised to do. 

He's had to endure some awful misfortune - but this guy shows us all how to stand up and fight - and not just for cash.

I purchased this dvd because I own the 2nd one and like it so much.  Boy, was I disappointed!  The abs diet people must have decided to create the second dvd because this one needed a good edit.  The second dvd covers basically the same exercises but with better instruction and form.  Skip this one and buy the Abs Diet Workout 2

I'm not keen on workout tapes or DVDs but I bought this because I got a deal when I bought the book, too.  But this is a great workout DVD with 3 levels, one right for everyone.  It doesn't take long to work out with it and the music that accompanies the action really gets you going.  I've lost 15 pounds in 6 weeks by using the Abs Diet book (it shouldn't be called a diet - more of a lifestyle change in a positive way that anyone can stick with) and the DVD

I have dozens of workout videos and I have been religious about this one!  I usually just do beginning, intermediate and advanced for one long workout.  I disagree that it is only for women, I think it is for men too-but most men I know don't like working out to videos.  It is a great video and I have already recommended it to my friends

<review_text>

This is the perfect DVD companion for the The Abs Diet Book. 

You eat more frequently, you eat consciously, and you exercise. It works !!! This plan keeps your metabolism at maximum speed all day long. I eat more than I ever ate before, and I have been able to keep in good shape. 

I was able to lost more than 200 lbs, I have been able to keep in shape for more than two years. I am in the best shape of my life thanks to The ABS Diet. 

The really important thing for me is not just that I look great, but that I feel great and that I am healthier than ever. 

Don't take my word, try the ABS diet and I am sure that you will get the results that you expect. Just stay in the plant until it becomes habit. !!!

Another tools you may want to consider, to complement The ABS Diet DVD and book with your strategies for boosting your metabolism, loosing weight, and even more important keeping that weight off are: 
- A Body Fat Monitor or Scale. This will help you monitor your progress, to assure that the weight you are loosing is fat (fat lost = increased metabolism) and not muscle, water or bone mass (decreased metabolism). 
- A Heart Rate Monitor Wrist Watch. This is an excellent tool that will help you monitor and control your Heart Rate in order to keep yourself in a burning fat state (increased metabolism). 
- "Ultrametabolism: The Simple Plan for Automatic Weight Loss", which is another very practical, readable and insightful book, focused on how to boost your metabolism. 
- "The Hard Body Guide". Excellent strategies, programs and workouts, aimed to increase your muscle mass.

I was wondering if this really works, because there's dvd's and books that just lie to get MILLIONS! and that bugs me a lot. I was wondering if it actually worked because it's sounds just "too" good. But I have read some positive things from this dvd. I was wondering if anyone out there that owns this could tell me and I would appreciate it. Thanks ;] *And for the 5 stars, I have no idea, so don't listen to that* 
Please tell me if it really works. okay thanks

Just got the new DVD in and I love it. I got into a workout rut, got bored and haven't done anything for the past 2 1/2 weeks so when I got this in I was anxious for something new. It's like any typical video but this one actually works you out instead of killing you or being so slow you're finished before they are. Yes, the jokes are kinda cheesy, the ladies in the back aren't using much weight, blah, blah....whatever----I had such a good work out yesterday I can feel it all over, esp my legs. I love how he demonstrates every exercise. And as for some of the reviews saying it wasn't all that, it's like any routine. You have to tweak ANY fitness plan to your level. If you're expecting a "made just for you" workout, hire a personal trainer. The modifications you'd make would be simple. Someone mentioned it was a "women's workout" b/c it has women in it and b/c of the push-ups. Umm, get off your knees, on your toes, and place your hands a little closer together. See, a simple modification. The girls in the video not lifting enough for you? Umm, increase your weight. It's an awesome addition to any workout routine or a great start for those just beginning. I myself will still make my bowflex the foundation of my workouts but I like knowing I have something else I can do when I'm just not feeling the treadmill or weights

A more apt description of this video would be "The Floozie Workout."  If you are a woman and serious about fitness be prepared to be insulted by the two floozies featured with Tom Holland on this exercise video who provide unnecessary comic relief in this otherwise solid weight training workout video.
The video is intended to provide a circuit training program to complement the Abs Diet, a diet developed and promoted by David Zinczkenko Editor-in-Chief of Men'sHealth magazine. The diet (details of which I won't elaborate on here) is a solid one and in many respects resembles the Weight Watcher Core program - it emphasizes a balance of protein, healthy fat, and complex carbs eaten in moderate portions.  
The video provides three tracks - one for the absolute beginner, a second for intermediates and a third for those more advanced.  Frankly, the advanced track is not all that advanced.  If you are interested in weight training and have no experience (be sure to consult your physician before starting an exercise program), I suggest you start with the beginner circuit.  After several weeks when you feel confident, you should be able to tackle the intermediate circuit and shortly thereafter the advanced circuits.  If you are looking for a serious weight training workout you should strongly consider Jari Love's "Get Ripped" workout - more rigorous, emphasizes tempo training, and grows with you (many variations demonstrated/discussed other than merely increasing the weight).
The video opens with a very short cardio workout and then segues into the beginner's workout.  Holland introduces each exercise and then takes the viewer through one set of reps.  He is accompanied by two women who carry very light weights and go through the motions.  If you truly want to make this a circuit you need to repeat the exercise circuit at least once if not twice.  The intermediate and advanced circuits feature the same basic exercises as in the beginner circuit but take it up a "notch" by adding light weight to some exercises and in the advanced doing double duty on others (upper body/lower body).  If you are in any kind of shape you will probably benefit the most by combining all three circuits sequentially as cued on the video.  The whole workout will take less than one hour.  Don't expect abs though.  If you want abs you really need to watch your diet - eat really clean - and do some serious core work and this workout just doesn't have it.

As a professional trainer, my biggest concern is for begginers or sedentary people in search of a safe, appropriate way to get started with an effective program.

For these people, there are alot of bad choices out there. But this DVD is perfect for beginners - safe, efficient and not overwhelming - A great way to build a fitness foundation.

I love the Abs Diet itself so I was expecting great things from the workout. It was pretty good, but the moves are nothing new. I was disappointed that the "Advanced Total Body Circuit Training" was actually just 12 squats, 12 lunges, and some push-ups and that was it. Don't get me wrong I felt it the next day, but only after I did the routine twice. The exercises are definitely effective, but they're nothing spectacular or new. Overall it's a great workout, but as you get a little stronger you can expect to have to do the routine more than once or add weight in order for it to be effective.

I have two of the Prevention Fitness Systems dance videos and they are two of my three favorites.  I am familiar with the teachers from earlier Crunch dance work-out videos.   I have to work at it a bit to get my heart rate up to where I want it by putting in some extra oomph.  But it is do-able and I very much enjoy the routines.  They are the right length of time for me too.  I have a small amount of workout space and am able to do these in that space.  I look forward to my workout with this DVD

This is one of my best buys of the year by far.  Marie Forleo who led Crunch Cardio Dance Blast leads you through this dance workout.  She is joined by 4 other ladies, a couple of them I have also seen in Crunch workouts.  The are 2-15 minute dance routines, Afro-Latin and Reggae Funk.  A warm up and isolations segment precedes the dance workouts and the cool down follows.

The warmup is short and sweet, then you move into the isolations or dance basics segment.  These moves are designed to increase range of motion, coordination and muscle definition.  Some of the moves included her are shoulder rolls, hip circles, the box and more hip shakes.  This section is probably not necessary once you master the dance routines, but I find myself doing it anyway because I enjoy it, plus I like the music too.

Afro latin is the first dance routine consisting of african tribal and latin moves.  Steps seen here are the triple step, strong arm movements, salsa, shoulder shimmeys, african footwork/arm movements, mambos, play the drums/maracas, double lunges, and hip shakes &amp; shimmeys.  Marie will show the move first slowly, then will add arm movements, then will do the move at tempo, repeating a few times.  She does this for all the steps, once each move is added and practiced a few times, she will take the routine from the top. Once all the steps are learned, you will run through the entire routine twice at the end.

Reggae funk is the second dance routine, steps in this segment include reggae groove, single single double steps, twist &amp; shrugs, drop &amp; roll, butterly, dig &amp; freeze, and willy bounce and mambo sunshine.  Marie teaches this one in the same manner.  The routine starts out a little slow matching the music but picks up at the end and is a lot of fun.  After this segment Marie leads you through a brief cooldown and stretch.

I really like this video, Marie is a great instructor.  I liked her quite well in Crunch Cardio Dance Blast and was hoping I would find another video with her in it.  This video is good for clutzy types like myself, the steps are pretty easy to pick up, though I can't seem to get the single single double step down for some reason.  Ths music is good, the set is clean and bright, and Marie and her participants seem to be enjoying themselves.  Is this workout a sweatfest?  No, but it's a nice way to get some light cardio and is great for days you are not up to a strenuous workout but want to get some movement. I find that I can be really lazy in the cardio department at times, but usually can muster up the energy to do this video.

There are a few additional features on this DVD, a fitness do's and don'ts segment led by Chris Freytag, who leads many of the Prevention Fitness DVDs.  There is also a Spanish instructions option, which I haven't seen in  another workout.  Overall I highly recommend this one.  It has taken me a while to find a dance workout that I really like, I finally did

If you have reasonable expectations of exercise DVDs, then you will ignore the review written by "AMAZON FAN" and take heed of all of the other reviews.  Because this DVD is classified as a 'Fitness &amp; Yoga' DVD, you do have to assume that it is a DVD for exactly that, 'Fitness'.  It is not, nor is it ever intended to be, an instructional for dance.  You're browsing in the wrong category if thats what you're after.  In fact, if you want to learn how to dance and will find yourself disappointed with any aerobics-esque moves, then shut down the computer now and go and sign up at your local dance studio. 

I own several dance aerobics DVDs and this is one of the best that I've tried so far - only topped by Madonna Grime's African Beat-Latin Heat DVD.  Few dance DVDs strike that balance between being dancy enough to be original &amp; fun, and being easy to follow.

This is as close as it gets to a perfect balance.  Marie Forleo is a fantastic instructor, and goes through fast moves at half tempo a few times before letting it fly at full speed.  That being said, full speed isn't breakneck speed; you are still able to actually DO the moves without compromising form.

Here's what you get:

5MIN WARMUP - Marie takes you through about a 5min warmup that incorporates toe taps and step-touches - your basic aerobics stuff to get you started, and then with a few stretches to follow.  Its not incredibly innovative stuff, but hey, its the warmup.  It does its job, and thats all you can ask.

ISOLATIONS - Now this is a good idea for those who are inexperienced with dance aerobics.  This short segment guides you on correct form when performing the moves, and is a must-do for those who are new to this sort of thing, and in particular, those who are inflexible in the hips.

15MIN AFRO-LATIN DANCE SEGMENT - This is my favourite segment on the DVD.  Marie goes through the majority of the moves at half tempo first - some of them are basic enough to learn at full tempo.  There is some pretty quick footwork in a salsa move that she teaches at the beginning of the combination, though with a few times practice you should have it down.  What struck me the most about this segment was that halfway through it the music suddenly picked up and was cleverly synched with the combination.  The first half is very much a 'getting-your-heart-rate-up-and-learning-the- moves' segment and the music at this point is fairly stock-standard stuff.  At the halfway point the music suddenly resembles that of a Brazilan Carnival, and it is at THIS point where you really start to get into the groove of the workout and find yourself having a blast.

15MIN REGGAE-FUNK DANCE SEGMENT - I wasn't too sure what to expect with this segment, since for me, Reggae Music has always made me want to go and lie down on a beach somewhere, rather than get on up and boogie.  The choreography in this segment is innovative and funky, but the music is exactly as Reggae music is - laid back.  The choreography does get your heart rate up and the moves are fun, but it doesn't draw you in like the Afro-Latin segment does.

5MIN COOLDOWN - Just like the warmup, this bit does its job.  Marie goes through a few simple, non-dance inspired, low impact moves to lower your heart rate.  Her stretches are not comprehensive, but they're not bad.

There are a few extras on the disc; particularly a segment presented by Chris Freytag on 'The Do's and Don'ts of Exercise'.  Rather than the Do's and Don'ts of 'Exercise', this is specifically of 'Toning', and she demonstrates what poor technique looks like and what you should be doing instead.

For those of you who have attempted the other Prevention Dance DVD with Jennifer Galardi, you can relax.  This DVD is nowhere near as fast paced as that one is.  That DVD is a Prevention Express DVD, where the segments are only 10 minutes long - designed for a 'pop-in-and-dash-out-the-door' lifestyle.  This DVD lengthens the segments a bit so that there is proper guidance on what to do, so you won't be left feeling as disheartened from trying to follow Marie's moves.

Marie has one other DVD out, the 'Cardio Dance Blast' DVD from Crunch, which I found to be a bit slow and not as aerobic as this one is - though I have no gripes about her personality at all.  She focuses more on technique  and cueing rather than trying to motivate you.  If you're looking for someone who will take your hand and walk you through a workout, congratulating you on every single step you take and telling you that you're beautiful and that they're proud of you, you need a Denise Austin workout.  Marie is NOT Denise Austin (for some of you, knowing that will be enough to buy this DVD! Ha!) and cues and teaches very well.  You need to do the motivating yourself.

IN SUMMARY
- 2 x 15min Dance Segments
- Isolations segment for newbies
- Afro-Latin Segment is most fun
- Choreography is innovative and funky
- Complicated and/or Fast moves are taught at half tempo first
- Marie is a good instructor, but does not try to motivate

Highly Recommended

I wanted a workout that would be fun and that would also make me sweat.  I love this DVD.  I have two left feet and it was so easy for me to pick up the moves.  Maria is a great instructor and she makes it so easy to follow the workout.

I started with Cardio Dance Blast by Marie Forleo also and I like it so much that I was looking for more work out done by this girl.
I found this DVD and I absolutely love it just as the other one. She is a great instructor. The way she breaks out the steps and put them together makes it so easy to follow. I am having fun and working out at the same time. It is the perfect combination. I started dancing with her like a month ago and I already have very good results. Finally my waist is shrinking!
I highly recommend this DVD along with her previous one.

Prevention bring out some good workouts and this is another of them.  It's a fun dance workout that is easy to do because you sometimes don't realise that you are working out.
The instructor Marie, has been in a crunch dvd I have and she's good in that and good in this.  She's a good cuer and she's motivating too.  She begins to teach a base move and then shows it at a faster tempo and then adds on to that initial move.  The Afro/Latin section is the best because that's the funkiest and there are some cool moves.  There is also Regae/Funk .  The entire workout is about 50 or so minutes, but as I said, you don't realise you're working out, but in fact you are and you're also burning a lot of calories and fat.  This is good.  I enjoy it

My wife, a Russian, turned me on to this movie a few years ago.  Since then, it's been one of our favorites.  It is definitely worth buying if you have any interest in Russia.  So many everyday sayings came out of these old soviet comedies.  It's also a more honest portrayal of Russia than we (Americans) have been fed since way back into Cold War times.

It's important to note all the work that Image Entertainment has put into this edition.  The audio/video quality is excellent as always.  The menu page can be in English or Russian.  The subtitles are in many languages including English and Russian.  The Russian subtitles are very useful for people like me that have studied the language, but are not completely fluent, and also for the children of Russian immigrants.

First time I saw this movie when it came out in 1971, I was 7 years old then. I remember, I laughed so hard I fell of the chair in movie theater. Now I don't fall of the chair just because I installed seatbelts on my couch. 
What makes a soviet era movie so good is that they all have clean humor pretty much rated `G' without need for profanity and cheap jokes of today's Russian flicks trying to imitate worst of American movie culture.
This movie is still one of my favorites along with Diamond Arm and few others.

This is one of the best comedies that were produced during the Soviet time. It's funny, pointed, and represents the best of Russian humor. All actors who play in this movie are the elite of Russian cinematography and hold a very special place in every Russian heart. Those who think of Russia as a gloomy grey place will be pleasantly surprised by this light-hearted, clean comedy, with its quotes being a staple of Russian language. What Wayne's World is for Americans, so Gentelmen of Fortune is for Russians. Strongly recommend it!!

As I said in my season one review, "ER" started off better than pretty much any show I can think of.  It had an amazing feature-length pilot and then 24 incredible episodes which combined drama, comedy, and emotion perfectly.  The good news is that season two is ever better.

Season two gets off to a great start, as Dr. Carter returns to the ER to the scoldings and snide criticisms of Dr. Benton.  This is a great season because it keeps the original cast together.  It is not until the next season that Sherry Stringfield tragically leaves the show.  This season has the whole original cast and the addition of Boulet, a wonderful new character who stuck around for several years.  The adventures the ER staff undergo in this season include:

Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards): Greene's obviously strained marriage from season one finally completely crumbles in this season when his terrible wife cheats on him and then leaves him for the other man.  Dr. Greene takes the divorce hard, struggling with living as a bachelor until he finally gets back into the dating game near the end of the season.  

Doug Ross (George Clooney): This is perhaps Ross's greatest season, and the season defines everything that makes George Clooney a great actor and Doug Ross a great character.  A major continuing storyline this season involves Ross attempting to help a little boy dying of AIDS, and how his decisions interfere with Greene's beliefs.  Also, Ross stars in perhaps the greatest episode of the season, "Hell And High Water," where he saves a young boy from drowning in a drain.  This episode won multiple Emmys, and is a tense and exciting piece of television, and one of the most memorable "ER" episodes ever made.

Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield): Without a doubt Sherry Stringfield's greatest hour, this season wouldn't be nearly as memorable without her and her storyline is by far the best thing about the entire year.  It's a major year of growth for Lewis, as her sister Chloe abandons her and leaves her with baby Susie.  Lewis spends the year raising and loving the child, but trouble happens when Chloe returns and demands to have the baby back.  Not to spoil anything, but one of the most heartbreaking "ER" scenes involves Susan and Baby Susie.  It brought me to tears.  

John Carter (Noah Wyle): Carter has a very memorable romantic fling in this season with another practicing med student, but when she cheats on him with Ross, there is tension.  Carter also gets in trouble with Dr. Hicks when he spends his lunchbreak boozing it up.  

Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies): This is a great season for Carol, as well.  She spends pretty much the whole year dating the local ambulance driver Chep, and their relationship propels the year forward after the tragic death of Rowall, the other ambulance driver.  This is a noteable season because there is not even a hint of romance between Doug Ross and Hathaway, as she spends the whole year dating Ron Rifkin.

Jeannie Boulet (Gloria Reuben): Boulet was the new addition to the cast in season two, and what an addition she was.  In my opinion one of the most underrated characters ever on "ER," Jeannie has a very exciting year.  She has an affair with Benton and ends up divorcing her husband, Al, but near the end of the season, she finds out that Al has been diagnosed with AIDS, and in the finale, she has herself tested.  We don't find out the results until season three, however.

Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle): A big year for Benton, as he gets Ross into some major trouble but then pays the price when he finds out some naughty information about a local doctor, Vucelich, and chooses not to tell the administration.  

All in all, an amazing year.  The good thing about this season is that every character gets something noteable.  My favorite of the cast this year would definately be Sherry Stringfield.  Her story is unforgettable and it's a shame that the great writing couldn't stay with her character when she returned from 2001-2005.  

Once again, the DVD set is excellent and shows a lot of care.  The widescreen transfers are nifty and give it such a cinematic look, and the special features are pretty generous, too.

This just might be the finest season of "ER" ever.  The storylines are totally gripping and addicting.  Just trying watching one episode and resisting the urge to watch the rest!  Nearly impossible!  Buy this set now

Wow.  I didn't think it poossible, but several episodes are shot differently, and catch your attention explicitly.  As good as the first mainly do to the chemistry of the original characters, still is not seen in today's episodes making these first two seasons invaluable to those who liked ER from the very beginning

I thoroughly enjoyed the first season of "ER," and the second season did not disappoint me either.  If I had a problem with the series, it was in the different problems that the producers cook up for the main characters.  Of course it's fascinating watching the choices that each character makes, but the problems are becoming more and more debaucherous.  It would be nice to see positive character development instead of the constant angst that seems to be mounting underneath the surface.  Watching "ER" is like eating chocolate:  It's good in medium-sized doses, but too much at a time can leave a bad taste in your mouth.  But I would say the purchase is worth the cost

and even today it still delivers the same impact that it did then.  The acting of the main characters is superb, and their ability to deliver drama the way it is written and the way it should be is truly a gift to all fans of this show.  I found myself watching episode after episode of this season as well as seasons 1 and 3.  Season 4 needs to come out soon so as I can continue watching this series in order

Nominated for 25 Golden Globes and 110 Emmys, including 7 for Outstanding Drama Series, ER has long been one of the best prime-time shows on television. Premiering in September 1994 on NBC, the hour-long hospital drama vividly illustrates the intensity and fast-paced stress endemic to hospital emergency rooms across America. Brought into being by Michael Crichton - famous Hollywood insider, novelist, and brains behind such films as Jurassic Park, Twister, and Timeline - ER fulfills its creator's ultimate vision (it took over a decade of pitching the show before network executives bit) for a close-to-life glimpse of the technology and the humanity omnipresent in the ER. Since its inception, many cast members have passed through the halls of ER, many of them having gone on to become big stars in Hollywood...

ER follows the exploits of a group of emergency room staff who work in a busy Chicago hospital. The show attempts to examine every detail of the ER experience. From the exhilaration of saving a life to the tedium caused by mountains of paperwork, all the highs and lows are covered. In the show's first year, a number of regular faces staffed the ER. Doctors Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle), Douglas Ross (George Clooney), and Susan Lewis (Sherri Stringfield) were regulars in the ER along with Head Nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies) and Benton's medical student understudy (and later ER doctor), John Carter (Noah Wyle)... Any given episode tends to run multiple plot lines throughout the show, interweaving scenes in short snippets intended to heighten audience emotion and create the aura of a stress-laden atmosphere. The show's high drama, coupled with subplots of the staffers' personal lives and the display of cutting edge medical technology, combine to make ER one of most adrenaline-inducing programs in television history... 

The ER (Season 2) DVD features a number of dramatic episodes including the season premiere "Welcome Back, Carter!" in which Carter arrives late for his new position in the ER while Mark gets comfortable in his new position among the senior staff. Meanwhile, the ER tries to patch up the victims of a rival gang war, and new medical school students arrive in the ER for their rotations... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include "Hell and High Water" in which Doug happens upon a young boy trapped in a drain pipe rapidly filling with water, and "A Shift in the Night" in which Mark is forced to carry the load of the ER by himself when Doug is out with whiplash and Susan is out on business...

Below is a list of episodes included on the ER (Season 2) DVD:

Episode 27 (Welcome Back, Carter!)
Episode 28 (Summer Run) 
Episode 29 (Do One, Teach One, Kill One) 
Episode 30 (What Life?) 
Episode 31 (And Baby Makes Two) 
Episode 32 (Days Like This) 
Episode 33 (Hell and High Water) 
Episode 34 (The Secret Sharer) 
Episode 35 (Home) 
Episode 36 (A Miracle Happens Here) 
Episode 37 (Dead of Winter) 
Episode 38 (True Lies) 
Episode 39 (It's Not Easy Being Greene) 
Episode 40 (The Right Thing) 
Episode 41 (Baby Shower) 
Episode 42 (The Healers) 
Episode 43 (The Match Game) 
Episode 44 (A Shift in the Night) 
Episode 45 (Fire in the Belly) 
Episode 46 (Fevers of Unknown Origin) 
Episode 47 (Take These Broken Wings)

The gift is a film about Annie Wilson a young woman with very real telepathic talents. Widow and mother of three, Annie Wilson, makes her living by foretelling others' futures, though her own has become cloudier than even she can see. Threatened by a client's violently jealous husband and plagued by visions of a missing towns-girl, Annie is unwittingly pulled into a thicket of lies and deception in which her extraordinary gift could be used against her and get her killed.I knew someone who was gifted, and from what I can tell, the movie was pretty accurate. And the musical score just heavenly.

This is surely one of the most seriously underrated mystery thrillers around, which is a shame since director Sam Raimi, just before hitting the jackpot with the "Spider-Man" franchise, has assembled a wildly improbable cast to inhabit an admittedly lurid though constantly involving 2001 movie. I was in a town on the southernmost tip of Chile when I first saw this movie in a hotel room which just happen to have HBO. Not even the outside splendor of a midnight sun could tear me away from watching the movie on the TV set back then.

Co-written by Billy Bob Thornton (upon whose mother's psychic gifts the story is based) and Tom Epperson, the plot revolves around the disappearance of Jessica Starlet, the daughter of a wealthy resident of a Georgia backwater town. Tired of blind alleys, the police begrudgingly recruit Annie Wilson, a single mother of three sons, who lost her husband in a factory accident and now has to earn a living as a tarot reading psychic/fortune teller. Annie thinks she finds a suspect in Donnie Barksdale, the abusive, white-trash husband of one of her most devoted customers, Valerie.  Complicating matters for Annie is her attraction to Wayne Collins, her eldest son's teacher and Jessica's fiancee; and Buddy Cole, another of Annie's customers, a suicidal mechanic traumatized by the parental abuse he received as a child.

While it's not perfectly constructed, the sometimes excessive screenplay contains a lot of layers but remains true to the characters' voices and motivations throughout. Raimi's expert direction is full of sumptuous Southern gothic visuals and genuine tension that escalates over the course of the story. Credit needs to be given to Jamie Anderson's cinematography and Neil Spisak's production design for establishing such a heady atmosphere perfect for the labyrinth plot. Some of the actors really surprised me with strong turns, including Katie Holmes as the spoiled, baby-faced debutante Jessica; Greg Kinnear as the seemingly stalwart Wayne; Keanu Reeves especially visceral and chilling as unrepentant wife-beater Donnie; and Giovanni Ribisi as the deeply troubled Buddy.

In the smallish role of Valerie, Hilary Swank makes her moments count as she cringes from Donnie's scarifying dominance over her. But it's the wondrous Cate Blanchett who pulls it all together with her multi-dimensional performance as Annie. With a convincing Southern accent, she reveals the hidden layers of her character beautifully as she tries to recover from the loss of her husband, protect her children and make sense of the psychic revelations that traumatize her and us.  The DVD is short on extras - a fifteen-minute featurette which includes cast and crew interviews, the movie's trailer and a video of Neko Case's "Furniture Room Lullaby" which perfectly reflects the haunting soundtrack. Definitely seek this one out if you are looking for an atmospheric, character-driven thriller that does not condescend to the viewer

The Gift is a riveting, very well-acted movie about a woman named Annie (Blanchett) who still has not yet gotten over the death of her husband and struggles to raise her 3 young sons. She gets money from social security as well as supplements her income by doing psychic readings for many people in the town. One of her clients (Swank, who you can always count on for a remarkable performance) has an abusive husband (Reeves, fantastic as a wifebeater redneck here) who thinks what Annie does is witchcraft and he threatens her life as well as the lives of her children if she is to read for his wife ever again. Then, the daughter (Holmes) of an important man goes missing. She's engaged to a man named Wayne who works at the school where Annie's boys go (I believe he is the principal, but I could be mistaken...sorry, but in any event, played by Greg Kinnear). But there is much more than meets this eye in this gripping tale, and soon the police, with no clues as to where the daughter is, turn to Annie and her powerful gift to see if it can lead them in the right direction. 

I won't spoil the rest of it for those that have not seen The Gift. Look for an amazing Giovanni Ribisi in the substory as well...he's terrific here. If you enjoy thrillers and are intrigued by the plot, The Gift is something you will surely treasure as I have. Even if you question the validity of psychic readings, this is a very interesting movie that's best viewed with an open mind. Very recommended

I don't know if I'd say this is a VERY creepy film like "The Ring" and almost scary, but it certainly is strange, starting with the plot:

Annie Wilson {Cate Blanchett} is a psychic who's "gift" is to see the future, and/or what has recently happened in a certain place, and she reads cards to the local people. When someone she knows  mysteriously  disappears, no one can find her. Sooner or later {after she is found dead}, the ghost of this woman haunts Annie and this "gift" is like something to protect Annie and her family, but in the process, the following situations become somewhat disturbing as the movie goes on because the acting and the cast are very well done. The characters make you have opinions about them. This movie is just so weird it's pretty tough to explain every detail...but then I'd be spoiling it, wouldn't I

The Gift is a chilling tale set in the south written by Billy Bob Thornton, the talented man that also wrote Sling Blade. 
First off, it is IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE TO GIVE THIS MOVIE LESS THAN 3 STARS. Why? Because of the incredible cast. Here, you'll find probably one of the best casts ever. It has Cate Blanchett, Hilary Swank, Greg Kinnear, an actor whom I can't remeber his name but who is brilliant and Keannu Reeves. Keannu Reeves? A good actor? Damn straight. He was brilliant in this movie and deserved an oscar nomination for best supporting actor. I am not kidding. His performance was remarquable!
The movie is about a widow, mother of 3, making her money as a psychic. But, she gets involved with a woman whose abusive boyfriend is ready to do anything. This psychic is a scared mother that only seems to be loved and watched over by one person. And only one. You'll find that one out on your own. 
This movie is packed with suspense that had me on the edge of my seat. So, watch this brilliant movie that I will definitely add to my collection

If you are a Sam Raimi fan then you know that his old car is always featured somewhere in his movies.  This movie is great in every aspect but especially because if features "The Classic"( which is what Sam calls this car) in almost every scene.  This adds a touch of comic delight to a very tense and suspenceful movie.  This role is usually filled by Bruce Campbell but in lieu of his precense "The Classic" is a worthy stand in.  All kidding aside this is an excellent movie and well worth your time.  Keanu Reeves gives an excellent turn as a creepy wife beater.  Cate Blanchet is as always flawless.  Every role is excellently cast and acted with skill by all.  Sam's direction is always great and this is no exception.

For what it is, this movie is great. Very not typical of a Robin Williams film, but that's just my opinion.  I have seen Robin do so much, from comedy, to this. I was very impressed with his acting. He made the movie and played the character perfectly. 

Plot
This movie is basically about a photo obsessed freak who is lonely and shares his time constrcuting a collage of a frequent customer's family at the photo place he works at.  After he is found out, the movie really starts to get interesting. "Cy" (Robin williams) does a variety of things to give off that "freaky, stalker vibe", and in the end, I really appreciate the orginiality of this movie, and I truly think it was an underdated release.

Pro's:
Of course Robin Williams acting in the film, Original plot/story line....

Cons:
Wasn't the best quality, sort of low budget.

Overall
I was very pleased with this release. It's probably cheap enough now that to buy it would be worth it for any true Robin Williams fan, indeed

This was a creepy thriller starring Robin Williams, which came out a few years ago. RW plays a clerk in a Walmart-like store, where he's the film guy, and has been for a very long time. He becomes obsessed with one particular family, who come in a lot for film development, and he begins to fantasize about being part of that family. He then discovers a family secret, which sends him over the edge. Williams does a good (and disturbing) job playing a quietly disturbed man

He has crazy fantasys of him being part of that family. He stalks the kid and the mother. And his store manager finds out he is stealing photos so he lets him go and he gets so depressed and before he leaves he finds pictures of the womans husband cheating on her so he switches the photos for the woman to see and the best part I liked was when sy breaks in their hotel and pretends he is taking pornographic pictures. best drama movi

Robin Willams' performance carries the lackluster film. It was a very disturbing turn as Sal, a creepy photo guy from the pharmacy that takes a obession too far with a family that regularly comes in. He immerses himself into the family and calls himself Uncle Sal. the atmosphere was great and creepy and haunting. When you get done with the film, Willams' peformance will creep the hell out of you. Also, when the hotel scene comes up, be prepared because it is one of the most disturbing scenes in the whole movie. 

I highly recommend the film if you want to watch Robin Willams peform a serious role outstandingly.

A truly great performance by Robin Williams as the lonely guy who desperately wants to be more than just a average photo developer, he fantasize about being a family member which develop into dramatic and frightning consequences for the part involved.   
Seen from a psychological point of view, this is not just pure entertainment, it reflect todays society in many ways, - solitariness.
There are surely many lonely Sy`s out there, although not as extreme maybe, `this is study in human condition and it involves the viewer into territories of reflection about himself as a human being`...
This movie has moments that stays with you forever.

One Hour Photo.

*** 3/4

Many people have covered the film's plot. I won't bore you with restating what many have already covered well.

My take on this film is a little different. A persual of the reviews below I don't see this angle discussed. Its regarding Sy's damage. 

The film's ending makes the most powerful statement. That statement is damage of children by their parents. Sy's whole rationale for his frightening acts in the hotel were simple: Mr. Yorkin wasn't a good husband and father. The emotional outburst about photos of children and things they shouldn't have to do said it all. Sy wasn't monster, but a person who is really scarred. The expierences of his childhood made him a mess and unable to interact normally with people.

At the end of the film I really felt for him. He became a wounded and damaged individual who had a normal life stripped away young. His obsession with the Yorkin's was based on the desire for a life he could never have.

The film and narrative are well done and paced. It feels sort of like a documentary. The creepy Mr. Rogers tone plays well. 

There are the people who will see Sy's actions and place emphasis on them. Lost in those views is what the writers were really saying about one man. Specifically this one man. A man who is a abuse survivor and carries that deep damage.

I didn't much care for the final scenes. Instead of the Yorkin's home safely as the closer. Adding Sy being helped as the final scene would've been much more effective. Speaking for myself, I wanted to see Sy get some help. Then pay for his crimes

The particular and sick  affective world of the primordial profile of the peeping Tom is to spy secretly behind windows, from the security boasted by the darkness. But the actual technology certainly allows to scrutinize with major intensity the particular spheres of other affective and emotional worlds. This serious affective disorder will constitute the dramatic axis around Robin Williams, an insipid and minuscule human being, filled of loneliness and hungry of affection willl fill his boring and non sense life.  This is precisely what it happened with this original study around a isolated man who connects himself  with the outer world , just because his work demands it. His personal fantasies fly in the wings of his febrile imagination. That is the way he gets inside into the particular universe of a middle class-family .  

There will be interesting twists and turns in this thriller that could have been even better.

When it all comes down to it

And when you don't have family
you dont have anything.


A very deep, and symbolisim strewn debut. A man is as fragile as a cracking windshield who returns home in the same rinse, lather, repeat he does everyday, like a hamster in a wheel.

"It's probably the person you least expect!" Says Homer Simpson on Sy's (Robin Willams) television. 

"No one ever takes a photograph of something they wish to forget."

Not a film that I soon will

Robin Williams plays Seymour "Sy" Parrish, a soft-spoken, meek, lonely, photograph-developing technician who has worked at a "SavMart" store for many years and takes great pride in his work.  Sy doesn't have much of a life, outside of work; he has no friends or family, and eats his meals at a local diner.  But, he loves photographs.  Over the years, he has followed the progress of a local family, the Yorkins, through all of the pictures they bring to him to develop, and Sy has a growing fantasy about becoming a member of that seemingly idyllic family.  The fantasy grows to obsession, and Sy makes an extra copy of all of their pictures, to take home to his tiny apartment, to cover one entire wall.

But, then things start to go very wrong.  Sy gets caught making extra copies (the machine's counter-logs do not match), plus Sy discovers a flaw in the Yorkin family.  With his fantasy and his job slipping away from him, Sy becomes quite unstable, and takes very desperate actions to try to make things right again.

This is a very creepy movie.  In the same way that "Fargo" portrayed a seemingly-ordinary person with enormous problems just beneath the surface, "One Hour Photo" makes the viewer wonder what insanity he or she has stared in the face, perhaps repeatedly, without ever being able to see it.  Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds" also showed us how true horror does not have to come from monsters, but can be in the shape of sparrows, gulls, and crows.  Other films have tried to portray this, but done it poorly.  The babysitter-who-is-really-a-serial-killer has become a cliche, and never seems believable.  In "One Hour Photo," we see a truly believable character, who drifts toward doing truly horrific acts, for reasons that are simultaneously irrational and understandable.

Robin Williams is astounding in this role.  We saw him do dramatic parts in "What Dreams May Come" and "Dead Poets Society," but "One Hour Photo" is an Oscar-worthy performance.  In the first scene, I actually thought, "Is that Robin Williams?"  He is the epitome of nondescript, bland, inoffensive, innocuous, and non-threatening.  He is not just ordinary; he blends into the wallpaper.  The cinematography, clothing, and set design all enhance this effect.  In one of the DVD special features, you get to see him rapidly and abruptly switch back and forth between Robin the Irrepressible and Sy the Invisible.  Truly amazing.

As you might surmise, I highly recommend this one.  Wow

Not worth it - only for anti-Christians interested in conspiracy theory looniness. Thoroughly one sided, but that would be OK if it weren't riddled with inaccuracies - e.g. that Paul knew nothing of Jesus' ministry, and never quotes anything Jesus said. Any New Testament scholar sees Paul's view of Jesus as fitting hand in glove with what is in the Gospels (and Acts), though Paul has his own emphases, language, and theological framework. This joker... I mean, film-maker, thinks that Paul literally never believed that Jesus was a real human, living on earth. Geez. He could at least read the books Paul wrote! The film-maker manages to assemble a few crank PhDs, largely from fields outside of biblical studies, who think that the Gospels and Acts were either meant as fiction from the beginning, or else simply ridiculously innaccurate attempts at telling the truth. Oh, and there's the guy from the fringe, notorious "Jesus Seminar". Do you find the following sorts of arguments convincing? "The Jesus story has elements X, Y, and Z. So does the story of Hercules. But no one takes the Hercules story to be true! And elements A...N of the Jesus story can each *individually or in pairs* be found in various of these 26 legends. So... " If you don't spot any fallacious reasoning in the preceding, this is the documentary for you! The production values are pretty good (cheapie old Jesus-film footage aside), though intellectually, the whole thing feels like a sort of college film class project made by a "village atheist" type, who revels in cheap shots, scare-mongering (about those fundies who are no doubt going to sieze power any day now), a gotcha-question interview, and objections born of misunderstanding (e.g. thinking that evangelicals want an ancient-Israel style theocracy, with death penalty for gays - oh, yeah, that's on the agenda!) A favorite cheap shot - attributing these words to Jesus - "But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them--bring them here and kill them in front of me" - words spoken by a character in a parable Jesus tells in Luke 17. Honestly, knowing something about the subject, it was hard to sit all the way through this stinker. And you won't have to know much to smell a rat. Sadly, the theologically and biblically illiterate crowd - e.g. who thought that Dogma or the Da Vinci code were remotely accurate - will find this kind of propaganda-like presentation impressive. It comes as no surprise at all, two-thirds of the way through, when we learn that the director is a bitter ex-fundie himself. In a way, it's like a certain kind of religious film, in that it never even tries to rise above preaching to the choir

A very enjoyable documentary from the personal perspective of an ex Christian.We need many such documentaries out there to help inform people about the dangers of religion in general. I wish some brave person would do a film about how Christianity came into being from an objective historical perspective. This film touched on the subject, but it was not really the focus of the documentary.Perhaps we will be "blessed" by a further exploration of the subject in the future

The best part about this DVD is the features, particularly the interviews with Dawkins and Doherty. The director otherwise comes off as a preachy, smug arsehole, who gets a kick out of making fun of fundamentalist Christians, which is like shooting dead fish in a barrel. the film itself is awful, mostly bad graphics, worse soundtrack and awful clips from old 50s Christ dramas. Awful stuff. The big finale occurs when the director gets into an argument with a Christian school superintendent. Superintendent: It's a matter of faith. Director: But where's the evidence? Superintendent: We're teaching faith and love. Director: You're teaching lies!!! The superintendent, discovers that the director had misrepresented himself and the purpose of the interview and walks off in a huff. Apparently that proves Christ is a myth. Obviously the director had no idea how to transfer the concept of the mythical Christ to film. Read Challenging the Verdict instead

I bought this DVD thinking I could get what my Pilates class gives me right at home.  Boy was I wrong.  This is a horrible example of Pilates.  The sessions just goes through the motions.  They don't emphasize the importance of form and breathing through out each session which is really needed for any skill level.  The transitions are way too fast.  Maybe I am spoiled by having such a great Pilates teacher but this DVD is a waste of money!

This was the 5th Pilates DVD I bought and the only one that I actually use on a regular basis. It's done at a really good pace and there are several workouts to choose from so I can always fit it in. Since I've been doing these workouts I don't have a sore back after my walks and now that I can see my muscles and starting to have definition. So if you want to look and feel like your weight loss is actually getting you somewhere then get this Pilates DVD and do it.

I was a little surprised at how challening the workouts on the DVD were, until I realized that there are multiple options and tons of variety.  A full workout is very tough and I would probably only recommend that for intermediates or advance.  Overall the workouts push you hard and do their best to stimulate actual class work.  Defintely recommend for those that want a results driven workouts

I bought this DVD despite the mixed reviews and have to report that I was disappointed with the purchase.  I have another Pilates tape (not DVD) that was one continuous workout which I much prefer.  With this one, there was no time in between transitions and there often were no clear transitions.  I also found that it went way too fast and tried to cram in too many things into each session

I think I just don't like pilates because I really didn't care for this workout. Plus, you are constantly roling up and down and from years as a ballet dancer we have always been taught that rolling your spine when working the stomach will not flatten the stomach it will cause the muscle to bulk up in your stomach and you'll have a round hard belly. This is not my idea of an attractive waist line and this is true because it happened to a girl in one of my classes. So, that's the main reason I just didn't like this video

My kid likes to watch movies a lot. I've seen almost all of the Baby Einstein movies, tons of Elmo's world... you name it and we've seen it too much. Most of these movies teach and entertain our children, but few keep us adults in the mix. However, when this DVD goes in I actually find myself singing along and enjoying it more then I ever expected. Laurie's voice is phenomenal, and the songs are all very catchy with light hearted themes. The harmonies show that this could be an everyday rock/pop band if they were to go that path. My daughter sings the songs and dances (which keeps her active instead of just sitting around like a lump in front of the TV). She loves this DVD from beginning to end, and she isn't alone. The only bad part about these songs is that they are so catchy I have them in my head when I am trying to get stuff done at work! "Under a shady tree, you and me..." hahaha

I couldn't recommend this more to a parent with young children.

I'm so glad we bought this.  My youngest son (2 days from 2!) asks for "OooWa OOooWa!", his favourite part of "Walk Along the River".  His older brothers (6 and 8) dance and sing with him to the entire DVD which is a rare achievement.  My hubby and I have privately and jokingly cursed the catchiness of these tunes but are thrilled to have at least one disc our toddler will watch all the way through.  Only my mother-in-law is sad--she cannot believe The Laurie Berkner Band has only one DVD

My 18-month-old son was saying "Laurie, Laurie" before a lot of other words.  He loves this music.  When he watches the DVD, he gets up and dances.  In the car when we listen to the DVD, he kicks his feet in delight.

Maybe it's because I had never read the book and never heard of Hunter S. Thompson before this movie, but I found this movie to be unbearably boring and so utterly pointless!

At what point in the movie-making process while reading the script aloud, did they realize that this isn't a movie?  Or maybe that the book couldn't be made into a commercial movie?

The "story" if it can be called such, is apparently about a journalist and his fat hispanic friend (called his lawyer) who go to Las Vegas to write an article on some motorcycle race of some sort or something.  That's completely irrelevant, because probably 5-10 minutes is actually spent on that subject, with an additional 20 minutes at most devoted to the guy actually trying to accomplish the task.

The rest is just Johnny Depp as the main character rambling mindlessly about a variety of subjects, most of which deal with drugs, or drug-related things.  Others having nothing at all to do with anything.  They are quite literally taking every drug known to mankind, and the movie chronicles them taking drugs.

There are some scenes in which the duo are in their hotel room, where the "lawyer" freaks out in a bathtub and threatens to kill himself.  In other scenes, they are in the hotel club, or at a restaurant.  No matter where they are, they are always high on some drug, and Johnny Depp's character (Thompson himself based on his experience, under a fake name) is rambling or talking very very quickly and nonsensically.

There are cameos by minor celebrities, some of which are world famous today.  Gary Busey is on screen for all of three or four minutes as a highway sheriff who sexually harrasses JD's character.  Tobey Maguire is on even less as a hitchhiker who bails out of the car when he realizes the duo are stoned out of their mind and crazy.

The only moment in which I had a great laugh was in the beginning, where they are hallucinating that they are being attacked by bats as they drive down a desert highway.  When the "lawyer" stops to pick up the hitchhiker, JD's char says "We can't stop here!  This is bat country!".  That line and its delivery alone deserve the movie its one miserable star.  I expected better from Terry Gilliam.

If this movie was attempting to be shocking or pro- or anti-drug or stylish or artistic in some way, it is obviously only a most acquired taste, like a group of people who think consuming waste is an acquired taste.  There is no moral message here, nothing pro- or anti-drug, nothing shocking save that these two aren't dead by the third day from taking so many drugs, or stylish or artistic.

Not the worst movie ever, but definitely one of them.  I don't know what orifice people pull this "great movie" idea out of, but I'd like to examine that, and find out why

Yes, I do agree with many of the viewers that the book by Hunter S. Thompson is better. However, I still found Terry Gilliams' wild and strange send up of the Hunter S. Thompson novel to be a great film nevertheless. [Much improved from Bill Murray's earlier attempt] Johnny Depp gave an excellent performance; however it was the character of Dr. Gonzo (Benecio del Toro) as the totally whacked out lawyer that I really found funny. [Funny in a very dark way]. This film may not appeal to many viewers, however, it appealed to me. I thought the characters of (Depp) and (Benecio del Toro) intriguing and hilarious. Plus, some of the other character actors in the film were pretty darn funny as well. I can understand some people not liking the film, as Terry Gilliam is not one of the easiest directors to follow: Especially his vision of directing. 

Moreover, when (Depp) and (Benecio del Toro) arrive in Las Vegas, the entire feel of the film gets really strange [Thank Terry Gilliam for this]. As I wrote before, the book is much better, however, the film is great too! Yes there is a lot of drug use in the film: One of the major complaints of many reviewers. I guess they don't know the life of Hunter S. Thompson, or his Samoan Lawyer: They were both drug abusers. Furthermore, I did not expect them to drink iced-tea, and lemonade while they were both on assignment. So, if the extensive drug abuse upsets you, this is not the film for you. However, the film [contrary to some viewers] is funny. At least in a dark way. If you don't want to purchase the DVD, especially the Criterion Collection of the film, rent it first to see if it is your taste. However, I thought it was a great film. And it is highly recommended

I was "treated" to Johnny Depp and Benecio Del Toro in "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" on DVD. Based on the late journalist Hunter Thompson's book, this one had a few very funny moments, and the not-so-subtle message that real-life in Las Vegas can be as hallucinogenic as a drug trip, but spent too much time showing us how people on drugs walk funny and trash hotel rooms and rental cars (without paying their bills, of course). It was a step up from Bill Murray in "Where the Buffalo Roam", an earlier attempt to bring Thompson's antics to the screen, but still a pretty low step.

As all pf us are aware about Terry Gilliam's border limits scripts, the repercussions and tendencies that occur, product of a progressive crumbling of the human mind; there us a visible breakthrough respect the established order, and the way to respond before this anomaly vary according the case.

In particular, this movie may disturb most of viewers, in case you are not totally immersed in the spirit of that age, plenty of absolute lack of respect and negation of basic premises. Don't forget the famous French May's ideological emblem: "Forbidden  to forbid"    

Caustic, acidic and uncensored gaze around these outlaw period of a recent history, that now is part of the anthological  retrospective. 

All the cast was absolutely superb; and the movie reflected with absolute veracity the essential profiles of its hallucinating characters.

A reporter and his psychopathic lawyer go to Las Vegas in order to report on motorcycle race...on just about every drug imaginable under the sun. 

That's pretty much the plot and the glory of Fear and Loathing is not its plot, but it's journey. Is it one long joke about the misperceptions, paranoia, and lunacy that happen while under lysergic influence? Yeah, and it is brilliant. 

It is a film worth seeing because it not only demonstrates (to the closest I've seen on film at least) just what a "trip" is like, but also it is a reflection on the transition of the late 60's to the early 70's and the "American Dream" (which those in Las Vegas so desperately seek to acheive).

Johnny Depp masterfully channels the persona of Hunter S. Thompson (in fact, I keep forgetting during the film that it's Johnny Depp....truly a sign of great acting) and Benicio Del Torro plays "Dr. Gonzo" is a way that is a combination of humorous, curious, and frightening. 

The Criterion Collection did extreme justic to the transfer of the film (both audio and visual) and the extras are worth the time. At 29 bucks it is a costly venture, but well worth the trip

I was one of the few that actually saw "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas". Not because of any affinity for Hunter S. Thompson(who I had never heard of before; forgive me I was fourteen), but after seeing this movie, which is best described as a "flawed masterpiece", I immediatley became a fan of the man, as I am still a fan of this movie.
"Fear and Loathing", the movie, isn't flawless, as at times it can get repetitive and I wholly understand the people who say that this movie is nothing but mayhem on film and passed as art. This is not a picture for everyone and the people who do not like it are not wrong and don't neccesarrily "not get it". This movie is made a certain audience.
The movie is good, do not let the above paragraph distract you, because it is expertly directed by Terry Gilliam, he of "Monty Python" and "Brazil" fame, who brings his slightly, okay totally, skewred perspective and skills to this film, and the two lead performances from Johnny Depp, who is flawless as "Raoul Duke", a Thompson psuedonym, a performance that isn't just mimicry even though at first it may seem that way, and Benicio Del Toro as Dr. Gonzo, who some feel is a little over the top, but to me fits the vibe, anarchy for all vibe that the film has.
Features wise this is another top notch effort from Crtiterion, featuring three commentaries---one with Gilliam, one with Depp and Del Toro and with the man Thompson himself---, deleted scenes, trailers, TV spots, an audio recording of Gilliam discussing the controversy over the screenwriting credit, tons of footage with Thompson, and a funny section of Johnny Depp reasing his and Thompson's correspondence with one another. The movie itself looks great, possibly even better than it looked in theaters.
If you have yet to see "Fear and Loathing", well, you may wanna watch it before you buy it. But if you dig the flick on any level then this DVD is a must purchase

Long on loathing. Boring, I fear. This trip was at somewhere I've never been, and I don't want to go there. A place beyond the event horizon. Who could care less about these people? Great title for a book, or a film, though. For some reason I've given it an extra star. I don't know why. Perhaps because it definitely belongs in anybody's collection of bizarre movies

Terry Gilliam and Johnny Depp made as good a film as they could with Hunter Thompsons book (which was long considered impossible to translate to the screen) I think the people who slam this movie would hate anything by Hunter Thompson anyway. In order to please them you would have to alter Thompsons bizzare original vision so much that there would be no purpose in making the movie. By the way--Did anyone but me notice that in the "out of control in vegas" flashback  scenes that Drew Carey and Diedrich "Oswald" Bader are in the crowd that is confronting Duke and Gonzo in a Parking lot?

I lasted 10 minutes. At times, I believe Hunter S. Thompson was able to write. This was not one of those times. His gonzo humor was just over the top, not funny, and stale to these tired eyes. Maybe it was groundbreaking once, but I doubt it. Maybe you should watch it while stoned. He probably wrote it that way.

Wow, I just viewed "Spun" the other night and I thought this movie was outrageous. This is sort of a guilt-pleasure movie but you want to take shower afterwards.

 "Spun" has an impressive cast of recognized actors. The film is, essentially, about a few days in the lives of a group of drug addicts. There is The Cook (Mickey Rourke, he truly makes this story worth watching), who makes the drug (speed) and sells it to Spider Mike (John Leguizamo), a dealer with a junkie girlfriend, Cookie (Mena Suvari, looking infinitely less attractive than she did in "American Beauty"). One of his clients is Ross (Jason Schwartzman), who does a lot of favours for The Cook and his girlfriend, Nikki (Brittany Murphy). 

 I was surprised at how funny the film was at times. It doesn't drown us in anti-drug messages, nor does it become one of those, equally tedious, drug films where you feel like the sober driver at a drunken party. The humour is dark, certainly, but funny nevertheless. A lot of it comes from a subplot about Frisbee, Patrick Fugit,  who is caught by a couple of TV policemen (Peter Stormare and Alexis Arquette) and is told he will be let off if he helps them get Spider-Mike. I will only say of the resulting sequence that he does it with all the subtlety of an undercover policeman with his badge stuck to his forehead.

This is a film with a lot of energy, that seems, like its characters, not entirely sure where it is going, but determined to get there, and quickly. Although I am sure it is boring to be surrounded by people on speed when you are sober, this film almost makes you feel like you are on speed too. The director, Jonas �kerlund, has directed music videos in the past, and it shows in his impatient filming style, as he plays around with animation, speeded-up camerawork and such like.

I'm not recommending the film for its style though, although I am sure it is the best way this material could get to the screen. I am recommending it because I liked the main characters, which I think will stick in my head for much longer than the animated sex scenes or the split screens. I can imagine an entire film about The Cook and Nikki, or Spider Mike and Cookie, or even just Ross, who absentmindedly keeps leaving a girl handcuffed to his bed for hours/days. What makes "Spun" better than those hypothetical films is that it puts the characters into their own little community, and we feel as if we are watching their everyday, speeded up, sleepless lives. Simply amazing.

John Leguizamo is hilarious, and the movie has its very funny, quirky , unusual moments. Not a ground breaker but in your face / spoof of dirty white trash junkie movies. Lots of dirty jokes just plain nasty for those inquiring minds. The only reason I gave this movie Five Stars is because of a scene with John Leguizamo on the phone with a 1- 800 number girl naked with a tube sock, Mena Suvari on the toilet asking for toilet paper and the cops about to break in the crack house, if thats not funny then comedy is overrated

Spun is an absolute pleasure to watch. It doesn't wait around to get noticed, instead it sets it's own pace, like for example - No credits roll in the beginning, no apologetic character introductions, there is no STOP sign in this film, everything is unhooked and raw,YET nothing seems to be out of place. The direction is bizzare, camerawork is staggering at places, the sets are like gutters, the music is extraordinarily amusing and the acting is another level. There are many characters in the film and a quite a wide variety too. The reason I compare Spun with Run Lola Run is because it was nearly as entertaining as the German wonderflick was. Spun is possibly one of a kind. I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed Trainspotting. Now, that is saying a lot. 

Unfortunately, I haven't seen many movies like Spun in Hollywood.  So I have no recommendations. This is an absolute must watch, if there ever was one

voices going in and out of focus, characters in fast forward, teeth grinding

<review_text>
There are dozens of Don't Do Drugs flicks that feel like after-school specials, with their sluggish morals and predictable endings. Well, I can say that the ending of this movie was predictable, but the build-up to it, the acting and the finesse with which the special effects were implemented (voices going in and out of focus, characters in fast forward, teeth grinding) had me SPUN from beginning to end.

Though Brittany Murphy gets most of the cover, the story is really about Ross (Jason Schwartzmann), a part of a screwed-up extended family that are all hooked on methamphetamines, including secondhand dealer Spider Mike (John Leguizamo), spaced-out game geek Frisbee (Patrick Fugit), and others. When Ross meets Nikki (Murphy), he gets hooked up to the real deal: a man that calls himself the Cook, who wears boots with spurs and a cowboy hat and spits, fights, and tweaks like a man. The movie, for the most part, follows Ross's exploits as he becomes the Cook's errand boy, ferrying Nikki around in exploits like taking her dog to the vet (who has turned green from too much inhalation), and otherwise taking the Cook out to score, buy beer and porn, etc.

The best part about this movie is the dead-on behavior of the junkies. They hug and kiss you, they reassure you with pretty lies, they make you feel right at home - but the second they're short on drugs, or you say the wrong thing to them, they scream and throw things around. The next day you're friends again until the next fight, which is never very far off. And though you are led to believe through the whole movie that the Cook is the head cheese, it is interesting (and accurate) to discover that he is reporting to someone even bigger. And yuck, is the personal hygiene right on the nose for these characters - their teeth are gritty, their clothes dirty and raggedy, and through the few days we follow them it doesn't appear that any one of them ever takes a shower. All they want - no, need - is their next fix.

The part that sold me from the beginning was the words that came onscreen as the film started up:

The story here dosen't matter. The main characters fuse into a missle of meth and insanity towards an explosive ending. Scwartzman escapes his fate temporarily and murphy is blessed with a reprieve but rourke pays the full price for his evil concoction, meth. Quirky directing and film editing can be somewhat distracting but not meaningless. Roberts is so gay you want to smack his face. he an rourke have history on film and play out their familiarity. Rourke is phenomonal again as an immoral genius, a role he plays better than anyone today in film. BR

'Spun' follows the lives of several methamphetamine addicts through their wasted, roller coaster days, but this is not your ordinary 'drug' film.  The ambience and atmosphere is so in-tuned with this degenerated culture that you can smell the illegal drugs cooking.  Giving the plot away would be moot, since it is a portrayal of everyday life for people of this particular scene.

So, what separates 'Spun' from the rest of the drug flicks?  Gritty realism, hilariously bizarre scenes, atmosphere, some great acting, and a complete lack of fear on the part of the creator and the director to dive into the nastiest of behaviors and expose them as pathetic and comical.

The sets are what you will see in real life meth houses.  The dress and behavior of the characters is very realistic.  My only real problem with the movie is that some of the jerk/flash camera work gets a little annoying, but still serves its purpose of bringing the "tweak" to the screen.

Interspersed in the film are some ridiculous cartoon scenes that are a riot, and two cops that parody TV shows like "Cops" and "Bounty Hunters", along with flash stills and hilarious action music.  I am going to be haunted forever by the Spider Mike (John Leguizamo) scene where he is jumping up and down on the bed with a sock on his unit while abusing himself.  You'll see what I mean, Leguizamo is brilliant in his role.

Mickey Rourke has proven himself to be quite an actor, a chameleon who can adapt to any role.  In 'Spun', he plays The Cook, a nasty loosing white trash cowboy type who cooks the dope for the gang.  Watch for Ross's (Jason Schwartzman) hallucination of The Cook's all-American speech in the video store.  "Ask not what the kitty can do for you (substitute the 'P' word for kitty), but what you can do for the kitty."

Look for a surprising performance from Brittany Murphy (Just Married, Sin City) as Nikki.  The more I see of Brittany's work, the more I like her as an actress.  Eric Roberts (playing The Man) may have had one bad role after another, but his part in 'Spun' is perfect for him and very well done.  The Man, with his earring and his muscle boys and his overdone lisp was too funny to watch.  Roberts worked with Rourke in 'The Pope Of Greenwich Village' back in the early 80's, and its plain that they still mesh as actors.

Watch for Debra Harry (80's group Blondie) as Ross's nosy neighbor, and Ron Jeremy, the king of p*rn, as the bartender in the strip club.  All in all, 'Spun' is a movie with a serious twist that will leave you laughing in the wake of the character's bizarre activities.  This is one of the best drug/bad behavior movies I have watched, right up there with 'Requiem For A Dream' and 'Kids'.  Truly, a must-see movie.  Enjoy!

I purchased David Garripoli's VHS a few years ago and I realized benefits from the first session of doing the Wuji "Swimming Dragon". I first realized the sensation in the my crown chakra. I also felt that all important burst of energy that comes along with the appropriate and correct practive of Qigong. 
The directions are easy enough for a child to follow and Garripoli gives the historical background to this treasured Martial Art. 
I would and frequently do recommend Qigong to everyone-not all for it's health benefits but for it's uplifting spiritual benefits.

I would have expected this many exercises to be split among three DVDs.  And there is a bonus backgrounder -- it's like getting four DVDs for less than the price of one.

This is informative, energizing, relaxing and well-designed.  I received all of the exercises I wanted and more.

I would recommend it to anyone

This is a great DVD,the extra documentary  discusses the history and current use of QIGong, with actual footage of the Masters in China. I found the QiGong easy to follow and to work into my personal schedule. It breaks it up into several simple areas and if I don't have time for the complete session I can do the areas I need most.

 I am a Reiki Master and I wished to broaden my energy work, this was really useful. I am also struggling to learn accupressure and QiGong in a 100 hr introductory class, this helped learning several of the movements my instructor was also trying to teach. To observe QiGong practised well, reminds me of watching ballet, as it is very graceful, with rounded movements that are enjoyable to watch and practice. 

As a nurse I am interested in energy work and exercise that can maintain health, flexibility, balance and strength that complements western medicine. QiGong can be a powerful tool to acheive this. I really enjoy this DVD as it is very well presented. I highly reccomend it!

This is my first introduction to Qigong and found the documentary DVD and actual instruction very informative and easy to follow.  I have been starting my mornings by following along with one or more segments (depending on how much time I have) and then moving on to the next segments on following days.   If you are interested in Qigong - I would definitely recommend starting out here

As a beginner, I am so glad I found this DVD.  I don't even mind the hour and a half long workout!  The movements are easy to understand and follow and Qigong has "kick-started" my body back to health! When I don't have time to practice all 18 movements, I do the short version that is provided at the beginning! Thank you Garrapolis

This is a great introduction to the world of Qigong exercise and meditation. The most valuable part of the set for me was the 2nd DVD, with the documentary on Qigong. I never knew that Qigong is a term and concept that embraces varied styles and methods of exercise and healing. I learned from the documentary that even the playing of music and Chinese brush painting can be a form of Qigong exercise and healing. 

The quality of the photography and demonstration is good and easy to follow. The movements are slow and relaxed, but I wish there was a multi-angle view of the exercises or at least a side and rear view of the movements. It was hard to understand the proper posture and stance of the exercises just from the frontal viewpoint. 

Another limitation of the instruction is that it does not provide a graphic illustration of the location of the energy centers (Dan Tian) and the path flow of energy throughout the body. I know Qigong is an internal as well as a physical form of exercise, and it would have been helpful to know how the exercises direct and distribute energy flow through the body. I wanted to know exactly where the dan tian energy centers are, and the way the exercises move energy through them. That would have helped me to understand the purpose of the exercises, and given me something to visualize and concentrate on while doing the exercises.

 This is a very well-produced DVD that offers a solid introduction to the art of qigong. No one video is going to achieve great depth in a complex subject, but having seen a number of qigong videos (many of which have shot-in-the-basement production qualities and very minimal explanations)I would rank this as one of the best, particularly for a new student. The qigong forms presented here offer slow, dynamic stretching, deep gentle breathing, and they are enjoyable and relaxing to perform. The second DVD presents a fascinating documentary on the history of qigong. Well worth the modest cost

The Harts, Max and Freeway made this one of the best series from the past.The chemistry between Wagner and Powers exploded on the screen.A modern day version of The Thin Man series of yester year, with William Powell and Merna Loy.They solved mysteries together getting tangeled up in all the plots and trying to get untangeled.Not without the help of Max, who was a character actor from the thirties and fortys and also acted with Shirley Temple. Can not wait for the third season dvd

At last, the eagerly awaited second series of Hart to Hart has hit the shelves. This series contains one of the classic episodes of the show, 'What Murder' where Jonathan loses his memory, forgets that he witnessed a murder and even forgets his precious Jennifer. Fabulous stuff. 

The quality of the transfers is good, not quite as clear as series one but an awful lot better than what most of us fans are used to!

The two greatest disappointments are the appalling cover image and the lack of commentaries or featurettes. The covers of the 3 individual cases inside the box are much better, one in particular is a series two shot that should have been used for the box. But hey, it's the contents that counts and you don't get much better than this!

Roll on series three and please Sony, we need a commentary on 'Hart of Darkness'

I remember the the 70's well. This show was my absolute favorite show. I loved the chemistry between Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers. It came so naturally that they didn't have to work at it. You just knew they were having fun doing the show!! Who doesn't dream of having more money than they could ever spend, and also having the choice of whether to work or not!! Let's not forget Max, who took care of them - he sure had his hands full! He was more family than servant - and we loved him just as much. He just added to the show's charm. TV these days has become so much more serious and reality based. What fun to lose yourself in a show that was full of fun, charm, and bit of crime solving too! The show may seem dated nowadays but who cares! It's still a lot of fun to watch. My favorite episodes from this season were the one where Jonathon lost his memory and the one where he played his own uncle, Fritz Von Hart. What fun!! I can't wait to get this DVD set. Hopefully it won't be another year before Season 3 is released

I was just a kid when this show was on... and I loved every episode of it. Back then, it looked sleek, chic, exciting, everything you could ask for from a tv show...
just like Charlie's Angels... or Vega$... I remember them all...

Almost 30 years later, it looks so dated... so different from today's fast paced, violent, end-twisting, loud, in-your-face TV. 

STILL we love it. The stories are so simple... and Wagner and Powers had so much charm... so much style.

Let me add that today I guess I still secretly dream about having a 1978 Mercedes-Benz yellow wagon with that big telephone (laughs). It used to be so super cool!!!

Wathing those episodes made me feel again like a 6 year-old kid just being introduced to late 70's television - the jokes, the kitchens, the hairdos, the telephones, VCRs, big cars, disco...

Oh, and I loved Mark Snow's theme. I recognized it instantly...

And Max's introduction to Mr. and Mrs. H... whose hobby is murder!!!

Do you want to know what were the dreams of the middle class' during the late 70's? Watch Hart to Hart. Everything was great. Everything was ideal!

What a great show!

Thanks for the memory.

PS... someday, someone will write a History of american society through the 20th century's TV shows' point of view. I'm sure Hart to Hart, Charlie's Angels, Moonlighting, Magnum PI (and many many others)will all have a lot to say. 

A classic!!!!!

For five wonderful seasons, "Hart to Hart" was about the most fun you could have in an hour without getting into any trouble. Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers were simply perfect as the rich couple with nothing to do but solve murders. They were Jonathan and Jennifer Hart, living the fun life we all wished we had. The chemistry between Stefanie Powers and Robert Wagner was natural and you could always tell, especially with Wagner, that they were having a ball. 

Sidney Sheldon created the characters but it was really a stroke of genius to cast Wagner and Powers. Wagner took his cool Alexander Munday persona from "It Takes a Thief" and just made him richer and happier, with a lovely companion he got to keep. Stefanie Powers always had a certain something but had never really found the right part, until Hart to Hart. Jennifer Hart came so naturally that you couldn't help thinking she wasn't really acting at all. Come to think of it, the same could be said of Robert Wagner's seemingly effortless turn as Jonathan Hart. 

This was heaven for light mystery fans. There was always plenty of fun banter between Jonathan and "Mrs. H" and enough humorous situations mixed in with the latest week's adventure to keep everyone tickled pink. Not to be undervalued as the reason the show was such a big hit, was Lionel Stander's role as their butler, Max. Max was much more like family than hired help, and in the show's opening every week, you knew right away Max was an important part of the proceedings. After introducing the self-made millionaire, Jonathan, and his other boss, Mrs. H, Max always stated that he had trouble taking care of them, because their hobby was murder! 

Not to be forgotten, of course, was their lovable dog, Freeway, who sometimes forgot who was the owner and who was the pet. The stories were frivilous fun, as this wasn't real danger, just TV danger, and we always new our favorite husband and wife would solve the mystery and uncork some champagne at the end. 

Fans of the show were delighted when the first season of this fun show finally got a DVD release and are once again made happy by the release of season two. A lot happened in the second season as the show just kept getting better. Jonathan had amnesia after an accident and forgot a murder in one episode. In another, Jennifer was kidnapped. Max's ex-wife showed up and caused tons of trouble. And Jennifer was stalked by a mummy when a not so ancient body was found in an Egyptian sarcophagus! "Hart to Hart" was delightful escapist fare. Mark Snow's "Hart to Hart" theme at the opening of the show was light and breezy, and fans looked forward to hearing it every week. Snow would finally become famous for his moody theme for "The X-Files."

The episodes for season two are as follows: Murder, Murder On The Wall, What Murder?, This Lady is Murder, Murder is Man's Best Friend, 'Tis the Season To Be Murdered, Murder Wrap, Murder In Paradise, Ex-Wives Can Be Murder, Murder is a Drag, Hart-Shaped Murder, Slow Boat to Murder, Murder in the Saddle, Homemade Murder, Solid Gold Murder, Getting Aweigh with Murder, The Murder of Jonathan Hart, The Latest In High Fashion Murder, Operation Murder, Murder Takes A Bow, Blue Chip Murder

The domestic and mystery adventures of the self-made man, Jonathan, and his ex-journalist wife, Jennifer, made for a charming and breezy hour of pleasure. The adventures of the spohisticated couple, who it turned out were just like us, only rich, was a great way to unwind at the end of a long day, and still is. Every TV mystery fan will want to pick this one up. So pop the cork from the champagne in the limo, call ahead to make sure the private jet is waiting, and jot off to TV land, where rich and attractive couples delight us by solving murders while living the life of leisure for a second season. Great fun

This was one of the finest written, and acted shows ever on television. The stories were truthful and heartbreaking. The characters flawed and likable. It is a shame for the fans of O&amp;A to have to wait years between the release of the 3 seasons of this show. Especially when you see so many shows of, let's say it, "LESSER QUALITY" like "The Dukes of Hazzard" has SEVEN seasons released. Buena Vista, this is just sad. Release season 3 for the die-hard fans of the show PUHLEEEEEEZE

Watching "Once and Again" is one of the most painful television shows to watch, let along watch again.  This is not because it is a bad television show, but because when it comes to dealing with the aftermath of divorce it is the most painfully realistic television show that has aired to date.  I would like to be able to identify with Rick, but my personal situation is more like that of Jake, and instead of focusing on the romantic relationships between the adults I keep paying more attention to the pain of the children when they talk about what divorce has done to them.  Watching "Once and Again: The Complete Second Season" on DVD, the character I found myself paying attention to more than the first time around when the series aired on ABC was that of Zoe Manning.  There is a moment when she reads her parents, Lily and Jake, the riot act regarding being the youngest and not only getting hand me downs from her older sister Grace, but also ending up with less years where the family ("Scribbling Rivalry").  Anybody who has been in a family that has gone through a divorce will find this show hits home time and time again.  If you have been spared that particular experience, then I really do not know why you would want what these people go through.

If the first season of "Once and Again" is about Lily Manning and Rick Sammler falling in love, then the second season is about how that relationship has a ripple effect with their family as the inevitability of the relationship forces their children and ex-spouses to a new level of acceptance.  There is actually more abut Lily and her new job (e.g., "Scribbling Rivalry") and Rick working on a mega-project for Miles Drentell ("Edifice Wrecked"), than there is about them being with each other.  While Lily and Rick are happy, for the most part, everybody else is wallowing in misery to varying degrees, and throughout the season getting all the kids together and on the same page proves to be problematic again and again (e.g, "Feast or Famine").  The major irony is that the dyad I am most interested in is Karen and Jessie, especially knowing what is going to happen to Karen in the third season and what Evan Rachel Wood has done since this show ended (although I am equally impressed by Julie Whalen as a young actress as well).  So I tend to pay attention to what each of those characters are doing, albeit for different reasons, but with more of an appreciation of how Jessie is her mother's daughter, which is not always a good thing ("Best of Enemies"), especially since Jessie is having trouble adjusting to high school and stops eating ("Food for Thought").

Having Miles Drentel is a mixed blessing, because while watching David Clennon is always a pleasure, when he becomes a wedge between Rick and David it is like watching Michael and Elliot on "thirtysomething" all over again.  But it does inspire a true moment of vision for Rick ("Ozymandias 2.0"), and by the end of the season it becomes clear that the purpose of having Miles around is to bring Rick down to the point that all he can offer Lily is himself at the end because his professional reputation and business are pretty much shot.  This becomes important because it means Rick and Lily do not have the money to find a house where their merged families can have enough space to breathe, let alone live.  But dramatically the whole bit of Karen and her law firm trying to stop Miles, and Rick, from building their project is more interesting ("Edifice Wrecked"), especially when it seems Rick might end up going to prison ("Won't Someone Please Help George Bailey Tonight").  When the psychiatrist that Jessie is seeing points out that only married people get as angry as Rick and Karen get at each other, it seems so obvious.  

This really is a year of one step forward and one step backwards for most of the characters.  Jake is the big hero when an emotionally disturbed bus boy shows up at the restaurant with a gun ("The Other End of the Telescope"), but bails on Tiffany when she wants him to be a father to their baby ("Forgive Us Out Trespasses").  Judy comes up with the great idea of "Booklovers," despite Lily's negativity, but needs the entire rest of the season to figure out Will Gluck.  Eli has found something he likes and is good at with his music ("I Can't Stand Up For Falling Down"), but is unable to build on it as his problems with school and romance continue.  Note: why Rick and Karen wasted time letting Eli apply to the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana is beyond me, because I have taught there and my oldest daughter is graduating from there this December.  I have to tell you that unless Eli is going on a basketball scholarship, he is not getting it to that school and thinking he had a chance was a totally unrealistic expectation.   So, my question is whether the people who put the show together know this was a big mistake and it is an insight into Eli's parents, or simply me once again reading way too much into the situation.    

My only real complaint is that this time around it becomes clearer to me that Lily is really way too judgmental.  At least when she does not immediately accept Rick's proposal (another painfully true moment for me), she does not leave him hanging for long and I liked the way he found out she had accepted his ring.  The fact that season two ends with the wedding ("The Second Time Around") might seem like the end of the story, but only if you make the mistake of thinking "Once and Again" was simply about Lily getting remarried.  It really is about trying to make two families one, which is why fans are sitting around waiting for the third and unfairly final (and incomplete) season to come out on DVD

I miss this show so much, Once and Again was such a great show with a well-talented cast. Sela Ward, Billy Campbell, Evan Rachel Wood, Shane West and the rest of the cast played these characters with authenticity and strength. Wood went on to star in the incredible film, Thirteen, I just knew her career would take off after this show ended third season. In the second season of Once and Again, her charater Jessie struggles with anorexia, her scenes are so touching and raw, what a gifted young actress, she was the main reason I tuned in every week, just remarkable. Sela Ward is good in everything she is in. My fave episode is the Thanksgiving episode. Patrick Dempsey guest starred as Ward's mentally challenged brother from time to time. I hope the third season gets released but I doubt it. All the finest shows on t.v. get the ax way too soon, it's a shame. Buy this, you won't regret it

Sorry, M. Dallas. The final episode of "Once And Again" was not a two hour event. It was a regular hour-long episode that aired April 15, 2002, as part of a truncated (from 23 episodes down to 19) third season. It ended with the fourth wall being broken, and the cast and crew spoke as themselves of what the series meant to them. 
There's still no word as to when a DVD set of season three will see the light of day. I am so disappointed with Buena Vista over this. Come on, BVHE. There's a real demand for this series. If you're a fan of O&amp;A, and haven't bought the first two seasons, then PLEASE do so. Then maybe Season Three will finally see the light of day on DVD

In response to Sue A. Elkins of Bloomington, IN, yes, there are only three seasons. The show was cancelled in it's final season due to ratings. I remember the last episode when it aired as it was a two hour event.

Season three, the final season, was scheduled to be released this last January. Commentary for the final episode has been done in late summer as they had planned and anticipated to get it released right away after the release of season 2. However, in late October, announcement came out (although not too boldly), that it'll be delayed. Word of it's new release date have not been annouced as of yet--at least not to my knowledge. Hope this helps and gives you some insight

This series was just an average series, overall.  However, I give it 5 stars because of the superior performance of adorable, young Evan Rachel Wood.  Evan has a very bright future ahead of her and will someday be one of the most successful actresses in Hollywood.  Just watching Evan makes this DVD well worth the purchase price

I was a huge fan of Once &amp; Again's brand of adult melodrama, but it's worth noting that season 2 was the weak link in its illustrious three years.  I was never nuts about the Atlantor/ Miles Drentel plotline that dominated Rick's (Billy Campbell) year - his ambition was interesting enough, his crises of conscience and "darker side" weren't as much.  Campbell does a rousing do-gooder, but in truth, he was always Once's least interesting character, and made a better as a supportive rod in the background than lead.  I was also not nuts about Lily's stint as trailblazing editor's assistant - not because Sela Ward's plotlines were insubstantial (for proof, take one view of her rabblerousing sexual harrassment episode "Suspicion" - which likely netted her deserved Emmy for the year), but because Jennifer Crystal Foley's artist/brat-in-a-power-suit-and-pigtails Christie was always more annoying than welcome.  But if some of the bigger plot machinations didn't work, Once &amp; Again moved hearts left and right with its smaller moments and extraordinary support cast.  Grace (the extraordinary, underappreciated Julia Whelan) stealing from Jessie in spite of herself ("Thieves Like Us"), Judy's love of Salinger and singles' nights ("Booklovers"), another terrific guest appearance by Patrick Dempsey ("Aaron's Getting Better"), and, especially, the emergence of Evan Rachael Wood as a major young actress - her heartbreaking work in "Food For Thought" steals the season.  Capping things off appropriately, the season ends in "Second Time Around," a wedding episode that's square, earnest, and simply so moving, your deepest melodrama-loving dweeb is unleashed, laughing and crying in spite of itself

Season 1 and 2 of "Once and again" were simply fabulous and great. And I was looking forward to getting Season 3 on DVD when it was announced for January 2006. Now it is suddenly pulled from the release schedule. Why??? I sincerely hope that all "Once and again"-fans stand up for this and urge Buena Vista to release Season 3 as soon as possible!!

I terribly disappointed by this movie.  It bears some resemblance to The Bone Collector and Silence Of The Lamb, but has none of the suspense, mystery, good acting and good story that these other movies have.  This lame excuse of a movie ended with with the killer appeared out of nowhere to confess his crime at the end.  The cops were basically two idiots who couldn't solve the crime on their own.  Add all the stupidities up and you have one boring movie.

This movie is weak, poorly written and has some laugh-out-loud stereotypical cop-schlock dialogue. The acting is sub-par for such a wonderful cast. How numb are we to poor writing that we accept such drivel? I'm amazed at the way people compliment this film. Really- Deep? Symbolic? c'mon! This is film is as about as deep as a kiddie pool

I can't really say anything that hasn't already been said. This movie is frightening, extremely suspenseful, revolting, and, above all, undeniably compelling. Fincher is in fine form regarding the direction of this movie, and Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman (one of the best actors of our time), Kevin Spacey, and Gwenyth Paltrow turn in exceptional performances as the main characters. This is easily one of the best films of the 90s, and any true fan of motion pictures should add this collector's edition to their DVD library

This clever and gruesome film was released in theaters in 1995. Definitely not for the squeamish but if you can even try to peek through fingers, this movie will keep you riveted. 
Morgan Freeman is a soon to retire police investigator, who gets paired with a nearly-rookie, Brad Pitt. Our young hero is married to Gwyneth Paltrow. The idea is vaguely reminiscent of the Lethal Weapon duo but it's not a laughing matter. The crimes they are investigating are heinous, and point to a diabolical serial killer who has a penchant for rendering justice upon those who have committed the "seven deadly sins." Kevin Spacey is particularly brilliant in his performance as the mad man, but all actors shine in this one creating a stark contrast with the gruesomeness. Nicely done.

Se7en is not only my favorite film of all-time, but the one of the few films that gave me hope for the future of filmmaking. I love every shot in this masterpiece and concludes with the greatest third act I have ever witnessed. If you have not seen this film, watch it. Allow it to change your life

I rate this movie 5 stars, or 9,5/10. The movie is included among the 1000 Best Movies on DVD by Peter Travers. This New Line Platinum Series edition is really beautiful, with a DVD case simulating the notebook that John Doe uses in the movie, and with a second disc full of supplemental material. I miss the typical but in my opinion mandatory "How it was made" or "Behind the Scenes" documentary. You see deleted scenes and extended takes, alternate endings with awesome animated storyboards, etc. The movie in Disc One comes with an audio track specially recorded for the DVD edition, and in my Home Theatre sounds terrific. Also we have 4 different audio commentaries, by director Fincher, Freeman, Pitt and other collaborators on the film.
This is a terrific thriller focused on two detectives (one new -Pitt- another about to retire -Freeman-) after a serial killer (always brilliant Spacey) who is obsessed with books about the seven capital sins, and kills people who represents them. After the 5th murder, he turns himself in and the last two (Envy and Wrath) are just a masterpiece of an invention. I've probably seen this movie just 3 or 4 times, but I can't help to be absolutely mesmerized and surprised by the genious of the story. 
This is a masterpiece of a movie. I rarely give 10/10 points to movies, so I gave this 9.5/10. To be picky, I'd like a "Hit" song with the closing credits. But that is just me being picky. The music by Howard Shore is good. The photography is excellent, the script is in my opinion the very best, and Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are fabulous. The movie was nominated for Best Film Editing for the Academy Awards but won nothing.
A must for any thriller fan and highly recommended to any movie fan. Your collection is not complete without this one. And for the price ($13.99 while I am writing this) you can't get any wrong

This chilling bit of film noir features almost unimaginable cruelty, graphically expressed.  What separates it from movies where blood flows like beer at a frat party is that the violence is never gratuitous, it is at the very center of the story, informing both character and plot.  Se7en is defined by superb art direction and an extremely intelligent script.  The overwhelming sense of dread and impending doom are reinforced with every carefully managed detail - the murder scenes in particular are so meticulously realized they resemble paintings.  The script sends characters, and viewers, scampering to the library in an attempt to understand the murderer's mind.  The bible, Milton, Chaucer, and Dante all contribute significant plot points - this is a film that talks up to its audience.

The full weight of this fleur du mal rests on the capable shoulders of Morgan Freeman, one of America's greatest actors.  His wise, world weary, and patient performance fully embodies the sense of hopelessness experienced by those who understand evil and cannot defeat it; brilliant.  Gwyneth Paltrow is deceptively effective, her fragile beauty and innocence are there to remind us that, unlike the early victims who courted their fates by wallowing in sin, true evil inevitably destroys the guiltless as well.  R. Lee Ermey, the Police Captain, unforgettable as the drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket, is visibly playing the role rather than being the character - he is ham-fisted at best.  

But the real tragedy here, deadly sin number eight, is Brad Pitt.  One cannot excuse his wretched performance by saying that he is playing an idiot.  It might be more accurate to say that he lacks the technique and talent to act the part of an idiot - and simply being one is not the same thing.  Watch him again and notice his tendency to throw his hands purposelessly, as though he is trying to detach them from his arms.  (This ludicrous bit of physicality was carried to an absurd extreme in 12 Monkeys, the Terry Gilliam masterpiece.)

Kevin Spacey, who only appears in the third act, is nothing short of stunning.  He manages the impossible challenge of making this larger than life monster real with an ease that seems effortless, an amazing achievement.  For those of you who saw the end coming, well, there's always Barton Fink.  Se7en is a brilliant descent into the dark places of the human soul - certainly worth owning

Se7en is one of the best crime thrillers of all time and probably has the best cinamatography I've ever seen, the film has the darkest atmosphere and probably influenced a ton of other generic hollywood thrillers and yet remains the only original thriller that manages to creep you out with out having any cliches. Both Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt were terrific in thier roles as the two detectives and have a tremendous job of making thier characters more than one dimensional you also get to see thier personal lives and then wonder how they don't get effected by the violence that surrounds them. All the se7en grisly murders that occur in the film are based on the seven deadly sins like greed, envy, sloth ect. that are done by a mysterious killer called John Doe cause they obviously don't know his name. So the film turns into this ultimate cat and mouse game with a very nice backdrop of the city which looks dark and is constantly raining, David Fincher does a great job with the direction almost giving it a gothic look. Overall this film is fantastic and is highly recomended don't miss it

This is one of the best editions ever. Being a graphic designer is great to have a high quality item like this on a DVD collection. Well, even if I wouldn't be a graphic designer I would love this edition.
Of course is not only the amazing "diary-like" package, or the great amount of detail on it, the movie, the director, the great cast, the bonus material and special features makes it one of a kind edition.
Highly recomendable

The intent of the director was to capture the ATMOSPHERE or "flavor" of the Elizabethan court. Intrigue, alliances, deceit, ambitions, trechery and emotions. In addition he means to show us that Elizabeth was a human being thrust into power, and all that power demands. On those points he got it right ALTHOUGH people were not quite as clean and good looking then. Times were brutal. A toothache could kill you. Lice were everywhere.  

Those who criticize on historical accuracy complaints miss the point. An historically accurate film would span very very many hours or even more.

The movie probably could have been a little longer as it is. Worthy of multiple viewings

This movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great, including a phenomenal cast, lead by Cate Blanchett, and great scenery and cinematography. The actors playing Elizabeth, Cecil, and Walsingham spoke and acted admirably, each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling, but the words themselves rendered the performances useless. The director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material. They should have read Elizabeth the First's biography by Elizabeth Jenkins. It is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain: had the author and director been more historically accurate, they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in Elizabeth, who is in turn hysterical, defeatist, overbearing, childish, tyrannical, who never shows her core intelligence, her great love of her people, who had a private core described by her motto "Semper Eadem", be always one. Elizabeth ruled with her advisors, she was not totally ruled by them. She would not have put up with Norfolk screaming at her across the council table, nor would Burleigh have allowed it. Cate Blanchett's wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine, wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity, much less truth. How could the director think that the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman? The ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all. We are laughably given William Cecil as wimpy and ineffective, and Walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne. One of the reviews said that the director inspired Rush to play Walsingham much like the Hindu god Krishna. I suggest that he should have first read some English history

Very few historical movies are historically accurate. Who cares? That is not the point. If anyone relies on movie to get their history lessons, then they are pitiful in the first place. The primary purpose of movies is to entertain. Its likely that anyone interested in 'Elizabeth' is not the run of the mill 'Die Hard' fan to begin with, and probably has some true historical knowledge. Those seeking historical facts should visit their local library and stay away from the video store.

To those of you, who have yet to realize what an amazing actress Cate Blanchett is, look no further than 'Elizabeth'. The characters, the costumes, and the production designs are good enough to make this movie watch able, but it's Blanchett who breathes life into the film and makes it cinema storytelling at its best.

The story revolves around the rise of the young Queen Elizabeth I (Blanchett) who would soon become one of England's most powerful rulers. Reviled as a heretic by the Catholic Church, surrounded in the midst of traitors, and caught up in a romance with a young Lord that could jeopardize her crown, Elizabeth is forced to learn that as a queen... she must become untouchable in order to maintain her throne. The supporting cast does an excellent job with special nods to the ever elegant Geoffrey Rush, but it's Blanchett who manages to steal each and every scene. Her performance was more than Oscar worthy, and is surely one of her best.

Some have compared this with `Shakespeare in Love' which includes two of the main leads from this film and was also released in the same year. Both are good films, but whereas `SIL' plays generally for laughs, Elizabeth is a serious film that should be taken seriously. There are historical plot holes - but these should not be used as a reason for slating the film. In fact it seems that Hollywood encourages this type of approach these days. There are any numbers of unexplained actions, and characters are sometimes hard to identify, but the camera work, color, and scenic backgrounds are superb. Locations are all real, and the acting is uniformly convincing. If an initial viewing leaves you a tad confused, do a little reading on the period, see the film again, and enjoy it all the more.

I am a fan of historical fiction, and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films I have ever seen! What bothers me the most is that the general public, who hasn't read the Tudor biographies like some of us have, will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject! I won't go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them. Why tamper with history, when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie.

I'm glad someone knows enough about English History to recognize the pure fiction of this film.  But in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy, I also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of Mary Tudor.  Over-zealous and fanatic (as was a common religious stance in those times - promoted by both sides of the Protestant/Catholic conflict), she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes.  And throughout the film, there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth - no objectivity whatsoever.  I was sorely disappointed!

If you want to get to know Elizabeth and the period in which she lived, I would recommend the superb BBC series, Elizabeth R with Glenda Jackson.  And if you want even further background, look to the BBC again in the Six Wives of Henry VIII with Keith Mitchell.  Tidbits can be gained as well from the movie Mary, Queen of Scots (although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it - for example, Mary Stuart and Elizabeth never met, although it was Mary's great desire) and even another title, Anne of the Thousand Days.  Those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times.  This film just doesn't cut it

I do not know if I can take another television series created by Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick.  When they came out with "thirtysomething" in 1987 it was like watching our lives on TV.  I can still remember all the married couples that talked about how they recognized themselves in the myriad machinations of Michael, Hope and the gang.  Then in 1999 they came back with "Once and Again," and all I can is that I hate to think what would have happened if I was not already where the characters ended up in the third season, because if I was still in first season mode when this aired it would have been way too painful.  In fact, I would maintain that there will always be moments from this series that will threaten to rip off the scabs, twist the knife, or at least keep you up all night because they hit too close to home for those who have been involved with a divorce.

You might have heard originally the idea with "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" was for Mary Richards to be divorced, and they could not get that idea to fly because the networks thought audiences would think Laura had divorced Rob Petrie.  But divorces are so painful, despite their regularity on soap opears, that there have been other concerns with having a show that is about divorce.  "Once and Again" is more about life (and love) after divorce, and the series dodges a major bullet by making sure the principle couple to be are already divorced and separated respectively when they first meet and sparks start to fly despite the train wrecks that are their lives.  This television series might be too painful to watch for some (I want to be Rick but I know I am a lot closer to Jake and that conclusion certainly hurts), but that is what happens with shows that are real rather than merely being considered reality programming.  

The fortysomethings in the main spotlight are Lily Manning (Sela Ward), who kicked her husband Jake (Jeffrey Nordling) out of the house for having an affair, and architect Rick Sammler (Bill Campbell), who has been divorced for three years from Karen (Susanna Thompson).  Lily works part-time at a bookshop with her sister, Judy Brooks (Marin Hinkle), while Jake runs the restaurant once owned by Lily and Judy's father, and Karen is a lawyer.  Both ex-couples have two children.  Living with Lily are Grace (Julia Whelan), an awkward high school freshman, and young Zoe (Meredith Deane), who has the ability to ask the pointed question at the wrong moment.  Living with Karen but frequently visiting Rick are Eli (Shane West), a high school junior who plays basketball and has some sort of learning disability, and Jessie (Evan Rachel Wood in the role that first got out attention), who is smart, thin, and working on her black belt in tae kwan doe.  

Lily and Rick meet at the high school when Grace has an injured ankle and Eli has academic problems, and from the start the couple find they are embarrassments to their children ("Pilot").  Rick is clearly smitten and Lily is surprised to find herself enjoying a relationship with another man ("Let's Spend the Night Together"), which is not easy when she finds herself working with his ex-wife at a school carnival ("The Scarlet Letter Jacket") and her sister clearly disapproves of the guy ("Liars and Other Strangers") and his involvement in Lily's life ("A Dream Deferred").  Meanwhile the kids have resorted to parallel euphemisms: Lily is "The Mom" and Rick is "The Dad" and have to deal with their own teenager crises in terms of sprained ankles ("The Ex-Files"), out of control parties ("Outside Hearts"), and the revolving door of adolescent affection ("Sneaky Feelings," "Daddy's Girl").  Then there are the ups and downs of the love lives of both Judy ("The Mystery Dance") and Karen ("Cat-in-Hat"), in the wake of Lily and Rick's romance, as well as Jake's ongoing involvement with young Tiffany (Ever Carradine) becoming painfully clear to Grace ("Letting Go").  

There is a major subplot in the first season regarding Lily's father, Phil (Paul Mazursky), who shows up for "Thanksgiving" expecting things to be patched up between Lily and Jake, who is clearly more like a son than a son-in-law, to Lily's absolute frustration.  Add to the interpersonal complications, which includes Lily's brother Aaron (Patrick Dempsey), the escalating financial problems of Jake that are putting the house that Lily and her daughters live in at risk ("Mediation"), and force Lily to go out and fin a job ("My Brilliant Career").  As for Rick, Herskovitz and Zwick introduce him to a new circle of hell when who else but familiar face by Miles Dentrell (David Clennon), who has relocated to the Chicago area from Philadelphia.  The conceit of the series was the use of black-and-white "interview" segments where the characters admit to themselves things they would never say aloud.  This matters on "Once and Again" because getting these characters to say what they are thinking without being prompted by anger or fear is often difficult and our feelings towards Grace, Judy and Karen are tempered because of these moments where their pain becomes most clear.  The season ends with an indication that the genesis for this series might have been the romance between Lily and Rick, but that what it is really going to be about in the next two seasons is how these two families become one, while maintaining tangible links to the families they were in the past ("A Door, About to Open")

There are very few shows in my lifetime that I have been fiercely loyal to, but the now defunct `Once and Again' without question, topped that short list.     

I will admit that my lifelong crush on actress Sela Ward was my main interest in this series, originally.    Single, with no kids, and in my late 20s during O&amp;A's debut, I was far out of ABC's target demographic for this show.    I didn't expect to like the show very much, but I got sucked in not because of Sela, but because the show was nothing less than fantastic.

Superbly acted and superbly written, ABC never gave this show a chance to find its audience, and it bounced around from time slot to time slot until it's all too early demise.     Even the best shows need to be pitched correctly to viewing audiences to have a chance.      The premise of the story is of Rick Samler and Lily Manning, two fortysomething single parents who re-enter the adult dating scene after their divorces. They fall head over heels for one another, and find that life and love in the (then) late 1990s is far different than what they remember.     Adding children, careers, parents, and ex-spouses to the mix just adds different layers of complications and challenges for Rick and Lily.

Most shows `jump the shark' at some point during their lifetimes.   While some could argue that the hostage episode in S2 was that point for O&amp;A, I disagree.   Once and Again always presented two kinds of television : good, and better.     The stories and characters could fill you with hope, heartbreak, or both every week almost without fail.    And best of all - everything about this show was real.    Very little, if any, suspension of disbelief was required.    

Perhaps the best thing I can say about O&amp;A is that it is the only show that I was so passionate about saving, that I sat down and wrote a letter to ABC, asking them to reconsider their canceling of it (as part of an organized campaign with other fans).     While the campaign wasn't successful, the release (finally) of the series on DVD will allow those who loved this show then to enjoy it forever, as well as allow those who didn't get to view O&amp;A during its run to discover it, and they too, might find out why we who followed this show from the beginning understood that this was just a beautiful story

'Once and Again' represented to me the highest point in television drama. This more-than-memorable series was no doubt one of the best to ever grace the airwaves.  Fine acting, brilliant writing, exceptional direction and noteworthy plotlines were the consistent standard for this series.  Not only did it excel in the heretofore mentioned categories, but it also broke some barriers for what television could do with a drama series.  Intimacy, nudity, sexuality, and other sometimes taboo subjects were handled with truth and honesty.  Deep character development was the standard not the exception...even for characters that had more peripheral roles.  The series was genuine.  I never felt a false moment.  I was heartbroken to see it end after 3 brief years.  Apparently mainstream Americans found this degree of depth in a television series too much to handle after a long day at work (or perhaps after 9/11)...or perhaps ABC did not promote it in a proper timeslot.  Regardless, My only solace remains that I can now revisit it from time to time thanks to the release of the series via DVD.

"And so my course is clear: to go through life pretending to have done and seen things that have hardened me -- made me aloof and unreachable.  Which works, until I need to ask a stock boy where they keep their corn meal.  Then the facade crumbles, and it's clear that I'm not a weathered loner who's seen too much; just a pasty Midwesterner who can't find the flour aisle."  
- Mike Nelson, 'Movie Megacheese'

'Once and Again' is about people like this, people who live in America's fly-over country, have never been homeless, are not famous, don't fight crime or work in hospitals, don't shop in SoHo or Beverly Hills.  In real life, they vastly outnumber the homicide detectives, criminals, trauma surgeons, and island castaways who comprise such a disproportionate percentage of the central characters on television dramas.  Why?  Two reasons:  (1) Most TV writers think they're boring and lack the insight and skills to write about them in ways that viewers will find interesting.  (2) When a show that deals with this kind of material makes it on the air, it depends on large numbers of viewers in order to remain in production.  Most television viewers gravitate to sex, violence, and suspense (and combinations thereof), and they are addicted to heightened reality.  They do not have the patience for character studies, and that's why 'Once and Again' lasted only three seasons.  One imagines that it was able to go that long because small but loyal numbers of viewers are actually bored by explosions, artificial suspense, and mindless exhibitionism.

Now we have 'Once and Again' on DVD.  I doubt there's ever been more genuine gratitude among fans of a TV show regarding its release on video.  Sure, there are a lot of great shows on DVD, but they're usually high-rated products that stand to do a lot of volume on DVD and are no-brainers from a marketing perspective.    (A lot of lousy ones make it to DVD, too, but does anyone really care about those?)  We spent a long time wondering if 'O&amp;A' would ever meet polycarbonate, then, later, believing that Season One would remain alone there.  That would have been a shame.

As good as the first season is as a stand-alone, it improves dramatically on subsequent viewings after seeing the second and third seasons.  In the opening scene of the series, Lily Manning wakes her daughters in a middle-class home in a Chicago suburb.  Beautiful morning sunlight streams through the windows.  It's probably easy to dismiss it and think, "Okay, so what?"  When you watch it after, say, "Won't Someone Please Help George Bailey Tonight?" from Season Two, you'll be prepared to understand.  In Episode 5, "There Be Dragons," Jessie slips out of a movie outing with friends to take a walk by herself.  She wanders around a mall looking at things, watching people, thinking.  There's a wealth of suggestions on what's going through her mind, given the context of events in the episode.  Watch it again after seeing "The Sex Show" from Season Three, and you'll find yourself filling in things that could not be suggested on network television in the earlier episode.

What holds it all together and makes it so compelling is that 'Once and Again' isn't afraid to let all the main characters be smart, decent people.  There are no moments of convenient stupidity that are allowed only because suspense must be maintained.  People sometimes behave questionably or lash out angrily at one another, but it's seldom a surprise, because it usually happens under circumstances under which you'd expect it from the character.  It's never a cop-out, either, because not a single main character in the series is one-notish.  The strength of the actors is critical, because they are required to render subtle shadings and quick revelations that are necessary to make many scenes work but cannot be written into dialog.

Fiction differs from reality in that it has had a narrative imposed on it by a writer, thus it is usually better able to illuminate human truths that are missing from an episode of 'Fear Factor' or 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?'  When you watch a television series in its original broadcast (or under other circumstances in which each episode is new to you), you can't know the full scope of the narrative that is taking shape in the minds of the writers, and they can do only so much to clue you in -- otherwise it just wouldn't be cool.  This is no less true of 'Once and Again.'  After you've seen every episode, going back and watching them over is synergistic.  You can stand outside the constraints of the moment and understand where it really fits in the arc of the story, an omniscient third person.  Would that we could do the same with our own lives.  The other function of fictional writing is to provide dialog.  (Would you want the contestants on 'Survivor' writing the dialog for the movie about your life?)  'Once and Again' is full of zingers, both dramatic and comedic, especially in the first season.  Judy, Grace, and Zoe get most of the funniest lines, but the rest of the cast -- and sometimes even walk-ons -- have their share, too.  Funny, ironic, and insightful, dialog like this works in several levels, and seeing them all springing to life at the same time is the real charm of 'Once and Again.

i loved "my so-called life" and was expecting something good here, based on all these reviews. but the soap opera advertisements they stuck on the beginning of these DVDs were a bad omen. still, i hung in and hoped for the best. i was sitting there watching and really wondering "do people really relate to this stuff?" the characters on this show look like they're from JC penney catalogs, or ivory soap commercials. white bread, sanitary, vapid... thankfully all the people i know in real life are a million times more interesting than these fake people. this show makes me hope that i never have the bad fortune to make eyes with some guy in a parking lot and start dating him. the kids on this show are cute, but all kids are cute. nothing can save them or the adult characters or anyone from the extremely boring writing. i am SOOOOO glad that the world is nothing like how it's portrayed on this show. NEVER AGAIN!!

When Once and Again first began I dismissed it as a show for just women. But after watching just one episode I found myself hooked. This was unlike any show I had seen before. I actually found myself drawn into the lives of these two families. Once and Again is not just a show about two divorced people who find each other and start to fall in love. It goes much deeper than that. Once and Again follows the lives of two divorced people and the lives of their children as well. But then it goes a step further and it follows the lives of their ex spouses as well. With the first season we see how the relationship begins to develop between Lily (Sela Ward) and Rick (Billy Campbell) and how their ex's still play a factor in their love lives and how their blossoming relationship has an effect on their children. Once and Again was one of the finest dramas on television and if given the respect it deserved could still be growing strong today. Even thought it's time on television was short Once and Again showcased the acting talents of Sela Ward and Billy Campbell and launched the careers of Shane West and Evan Rachel Wood. I am just glad that we are able to enjoy this fine show on DVD and that they have finally decided to release Seasons 2 and 3

This is one of the finest shows ever to be put on television+a prime example why network executives are ratings driven clueless morons.  For a show of this calibre to be cancelled while dreck like Family Matters,Americas Funniest Home Videos+Full House are allowed to continue ad infinitim is unconscionable.  Rarely has television see a presence as luminescent as Sela Ward--I am beyond thrilled that she is back on TV in "House".  The story of two broken families trying to pick up the pieces and find happiness again is done so well it is almost heartbreaking.  Adults+children are given mature storylines+allowed to excel--especially Julia Whelan+Evan Rachel Ward.  Ward especially is as revelation--more so in season 2 where she is given as story line that should have won her an Emmy.  Shows like this are the reason TV was created.  The 3 seasons of this show contain more real heart and drama than a 7-10 year run of the crap on today.  This is probably the finest ensemble drama since St.Elsewhere.  I would give it 10 stars if I coul

 I ordered this dvd set as a birthday present to myself, and I wasn't disapointed.
 The new print of "The Searchers" with all the extras(lobby cards,reprint of the dell comic, and not to mention the documentaries make this a fantastic dvd set-- 
 In addition you get a two dvd set for Stagecoach(which started the Ford/Wayne partnership),Fort Apache,She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,3 Godfaters,They Were Expendable,Wings Of Eagles, and The Long Voyage Home.
 The only thing I would have chaged is that I would have made almost All the movies in this set westerns(The Searchers,Stagecoach,Fort Apache,She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,Rio Grande,3 Godfathers,The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and The Quiet Man(which isn't a western, but I think it fits in well)would have been my choice for the set.
 That aside I think all the movies in this set are great and any fan of John Ford(or John Wayne)will not be disappointed.

THE JOHN WAYNE JOHN FORD FILM COLLECTION is the finest DVD boxed set I have bought all year.  It has almost nothing but masterpieces--not just great westerns, but great non-westerns like the Merchant Marine drama THE LONG VOYAGE HOME (1940), based on a few Eugene O'Neill one-act plays; and the World War Two PT boat adventure THEY WERE EXPENDABLE (1945), one of the great war films of all time.  One watches this set over two weeks and comes away with renewed respect for John Wayne as an outstanding actor, but also downright awe for John Ford as a director.  Not the nicest person, but boy could he direct westerns in Monument Valley.  And the Ireland of THE QUIET MAN (1952), which is not included in this set--wrong studio.

The set's crown jewel is the 50th anniversary remastering of THE SEARCHERS (1956), which includes not just a shimmering transfer of this dark and tragic masterpiece, but also a rare comic book, publicity material, lobby cards, and an audio commentary by Peter Bogdanovich.  Ethan Edwards, post Civil War loner and indian hater when his niece is kidnapped and killed by Comanches, may be John Wayne's greatest performance in a sea of great performances in this DVD crown jewels box.  But a little bit of Hank Worden's and Ken Curtis' unwelcome comedy relief goes a long way.

I personally think STAGECOACH (1939), with Wayne's first important role as the Ringo Kid, is the equal to THE SEARCHERS.  It has also been remastered and includes an audio commentary by author Scott Eyman, an "American Masters" documentary on both Wayne and Ford, a new documentary on STAGECOACH as a neglected treasure, and a radio production with Randolph Scott and Claire Trevor.  The movie is about nine people traveling by stagecoach through indian territory and features an Oscar-winning score by Max Steiner--the same year he did not win for GONE WITH THE WIND!

The dusty B&amp;W FORT APACHE (1948) and brilliant Technicolor SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON (1949) make up 2/3 of John Ford's Cavalry trilogy with Wayne at his peak.  (Part three, RIO GRANDE, is not included here because it is a different studio).  APACHE has a nasty Henry Fonda as an indian-hating Commanding Officer of Fort Apache in Utah's Monument Valley.  Wayne is his likeable subordinate who must carry out orders he personally disagrees with in a role that mirrors THE SEARCHERS.
YELLOW RIBBON may be my personal favorite Ford Monument Valley western, even more than THE SEARCHERS.  It has Wayne as a Commanding Officer about to retire after a lifetime of Army service, but not until unfriendly nearby indians settle down.  Winton Hoch's magnificent color photography, inspired by Remington paintings, won a richly-deserved Oscar.

Also set in Ford's beloved Monument Valley, but not a Cavalry drama, is the Technicolor 3 GODFATHERS (1949).  It has Wayne, Pedro Armendariz, and newcomer Harry Carey, Jr. as outlaws out in the desert who come across an abandoned baby at Christmas time.  This story is the third version of a movie done previously in 1929 and 1936 in B&amp;W.  I've seen all three versions and like Ford's the best.  It also stars Ford regular Ward Bond as a sheriff out to get the three men--but with a wife who wants the baby.  This is a pleasantly sentimental movie, often shown on cable at Christmas season, and reveals a soft side of a gruff filmmaker.

The last of eight treasures in this Ford and Wayne DVD set is the lightweight (and color) THE WINGS OF EAGLES (1957).  It is the true story of  Commander Frank "Spig" Wead, a pioneer aviator in the 1920's and later screenwriter in the 1930's and 1940's.  One of his finest scripts is for Ford's THEY WERE EXPENDABLE in 1945.  EAGLES, also starring Dan Dailey and Maureen O'Hara, is the sentimental and labor of love story of Spig Wead's life over several decades.  

Almost all of these film classics come with an original theatrical trailer, if you want to see how the movies were originally promoted.  That especially interests me when masterpieces like THE SEARCHERS, THE LONG VOYAGE HOME, and THEY WERE EXPENDABLE get shut out of the Oscar race, especially for Picture and Wayne's performance.  But, as they say, time is the key factor with movies.  And people still want to see these Ford/Wayne movie gems, long after even Best Picture Oscar winners are forgotten.  Should you buy or rent these from Netflicks?  It is an expensive set, in the $55-$75 range.  But if you buy the set, it averages out to only about $8 a picture, a ridiculously great buy.  Maybe it can be a Christmas present.  Happy viewing!

I recommend this DVD set for anyone even halfway interested in John Wayne and/or John Ford films. Great editions of eight classic or near classic films, at least a couple not available until now, a very cool 2-disc edition of "The Searchers", and a remastered 2-disc set of "Stagecoach". All for a little over $50! Particularly impressive - "They Were Expendable", the WW II PT Boat story. Good acting from top to bottom, great black and white film work, and really good, stirring, special effects in a couple of spots.
Also, "The Three Godfathers", a mystical John Wayne western? Interesting.
Only confusing omission - no "The Quiet Man", also a Ford/Wayne project. ??? I guess you've always got to leave something off to keep the customer interested. And come to think of it, "Rio Grande" was also not included, so obviously you can't have everything.
Side Note: Typical great service from Amazon.

The two icons of motion picture. May be the best duo ever, (director and actor).  Now for the collection itself. 1). The Searchers. This is Wayne's best preformance ever(by the way he can act)and one of(MAY BE THE BEST)the best western ever. Wayne can be brutal and then commpassionet. The supporting cast is also excellent,Jeffery Hunter, Natlie Wood, Ward Bond and Vera Miles. 2). Stagecoach, 1939 (What a year for motion pictures).John Ford made John Wayne a household name by casting Wyne in the lead in this film. Wayne's introduction in the film is the best ever on screen. The camera is out of focus when it draws in on Wayne then comes back into focus(a mistake,but left in by Ford)outstanding. Then you have Thomas Mitchell's oscar winning preformance and the beautifal Clair Treavor. 3). Fort Apache The BEST in the calvary trilogy and the first time on dvd. Henry Fonda as the commander(another of John Ford's favorite actors)with devistating affects. Fonda is obsessed with with getting the apache and Cochise back on the reservation at any cost. Wayne is caught in the middle. Fonda is a (George Amstrong Custard) in many ways. 4). She Wore A Yellow Ribbon. I think that this is one of  Ford's  best. And another great preformance by John Wayne. An ageing officer trying to avoid more bloodshed in his last few weeks of service. This is a masterpiece. 5). 3 Godfathers  Fugitive bank robbers are chased by a posse and are forced to the desert. There they find a dying woman and her newborn. They make a promise to the dying women that they can't go back on. They won't abandon the baby. Great story telling. 6). The Wings Of Eagles, The true story of Cmdr. Frank "Spig" Wead an aviation pioneer and writer. Maureen O'Hara and Dan Dailey co-star. Real battle footage. 7). The Long Voyage Home. Wayne's follow up to Stagecoach. This film was nominated for six Academy Awards. The crewmen on this ship search the sky for German planes, while in the North Atlantic and hope they survive. One of the best American films about life at sea. And 8). They Were Expendable PT-Boat action at it's best. World War 2 at it bleakest hours. The defenders of the Philippines and John Wayne and Robert Montgomery as PT-Boat commanders, try to give the U.S. war effort time to regroup after the devastion of Pearl Harbor. Story telling at its finest.

I am surprised that more folks haven't reviewed this DVD.  There are no frills or fancy effects -- true to JJ's style, this is a simple documentary that reveals the essence of Cale and his music.  Tons of great photographs and interviews walks us through Cale's childhood, how he became famous and most importantly an insight into Cale.

I have tremendous respect for how generously Eric Clapton praised Cale and   mentioned that Cale is his is "favorite person" in the world.

A must have for Cale fans.  For others, this is your chance to discover his music.  

In our current world of sub standard musicians and ostentation, here is a TRUE AMERICAN MUSIC LEGEND

Cale is famous for shunningthe spotlight so thats what makes this DVD Documentary such a pure joy.  You really get to know all about the man who wrote some of Claptons biggest songs (Cocaine, After Midnight) thru watching him play live, talk and return home to Tulsa where is all began.  Lots a great extras as well thru discussions with friends and family.  This is a must buy for anyone interested in what its like to be an artist on the road and how it all works as well

I bought this movie and loved it for the sheer wierdness of seeing three academy award winning actors in a movie about meat grinding humans and drugged runaways sold as sex slaves.  I noticed if Lee doesn't have much to say in a scene his upper lip hangs down on his face.  You can see it for the first time in "The Killers" where he intentionally got totally drunk before his dying hitman character kills Ron Reagan. As his career progresses, his scenes where his character isn't doing much you can see the hanging upper lip. You can also see it The Professionals. In the opening scenes of this movie where the mob boss is laying down the mission to Lee it can be seen again.

Being from Kansas City I'm always interested in any cinema shot here, especially since there are so very few movies made in this part of the country.  

When I learned about the existence of this movie with Gene Hackman and Lee Marvin I had to see it.  I added the DVD to my collection and what can say?  This movie and it's implications are almost beyond my comprehension; if this is truly how Hollywood sees the midwest, I am thrilled!  

Man-butchering ganster farmers, drug controlled sex slaves on the auction block, nordic looking homo-erotic henchmen, groin-punching good times between manical brothers, and Hackman's "Mary Ann" character riding high on a wave of murderous lunacy declaring his love of eating guts!  

The mind boggles under the weight of this grindhouse style masterpiece that makes "Blue Velvet" look like "The Santa Clause"!  

In spite of all of this glorious surrealism, the only improvement I could possibly suggest would be that it should have been a musical.  I will swear to my dying day that if this movie would have had some lavish musical numbers no one would have ever even thought twice about "The Rocky Horror Picture Show".  If Lee Marvin could have done that dreadful "Paint Your Wagon" movie, he could have been up to the task of turning this macabre little film into a up-roar that college kids would still be quoting every day.  

This film should be required viewing for anyone even thinking about coming to this part of the country.  

I'm going to go do my part to live up to this film's dipiction of KC by putting on my mother's wedding dress and making sausage out of whatever isn't fast enough to escape my grasp!

I saw this movie quite a few years ago (probably about 15 or 20 years ago). I must say the first time I saw it I wasn't really impressed. Then I read a review of it and the review stated how great it was and that Marvin was excellent and that it was just a great movie. So when it was released on DVD I went out and purchased it. I remember little about it from the first time other than it had Sissy Spacek in it in one of her first roles, if not her very first big screen role. I must say that I didn't find this movie any better now than I did then. I appreciate Marvins career and his acting as well as Gene Hackman. These two guys are two of the finest actors of my time but this movie is just not that good. The story could have been much better and the core of it is good. Marvin is a respected Chicago underworld enforcer who is sent on a mission by Eddie Egan (the real Popeye Doyle from the French Connection drug bust in New York) to collect $500,000 that an associate name Mary Ann has forgotten to pay. Mary Ann (Gene Hackman... and don't ask me why he is Mary Ann cause they never explain it) is in the mid west and has a meat packing place and slaughter house. He has sent back several other bag men to the Chicago mob processed as hot dogs and hamburger after he has killed them. Mary Ann also is now with Marvins old flame Clarabell (Jeez what is with these stupid names?). Mary Ann also deals in white slavery, enter Sissy Spacek. He sells and displays these girls nude in the same livestock pens full of hay that he does his pigs and cows. 

This is an interesting novelty kind of movie. If you are a fan of Marvin or Hackman check it out. Even if you are a fan of Sissy Spacek. But alas this movie is just not that good. The old school mob vs the new middle America mob that has reached even the heartland could be interesting and is a little bit but this is just a pretty bad movie.

I often ask myself how two really excellent actors in their prime would get committed to a project like "Prime Cut".  You would be hard pressed to find a dumber story, plot line or set of characters.  This is almost a purposeful testament to all that was worse with the 70's "Lew Wasserman" type production deals

Nick Devlin (Lee Marvin), an enforcer for the Chicago Mob, is sent to Kansas City to collect a debt from a rancher and meat packer named Mary Ann (Gene Hackman). Mary Ann was sent by the mob to run things down there and now claims the fiefdom as his own. Previous enforcers were dealt with in a way appropriate to Mary Ann's chosen industry. Nick takes his trusted driver and three mob goons with him to collect the money. Upon their arrival, they find Mary Ann presiding over a livestock auction, but the livestock in this auction is the meat packer's second source of income, prostitution. Nick rescues Poppy (Sissy Spacek), a drugged out young woman, and they leave. Neither Nick or Mary Ann will give in to the other, leaving only one conclusion.

"Prime Cut" directed by Michael Ritchie, and made in 1972, is a new film for me. Recently, Ebert and Roeper featured a number of Lee Marvin films new to DVD. I have never been a fan of Marvin, but the films looked intriguing so I gave a few a try and also revisited "The Professionals", one of my favorite films starring Burt Lancaster and Lee Marvin.

It is important to remember that the film was made in 1972 because it strikes the viewer as dated. Shortly after Nick rescues Poppy, he buys her a dress (she was naked at the livestock auction) and they go to dinner at the fancy restaurant in his hotel. Poppy's new dress does little to hide her breasts, but she seems blissfully unaware as the older men and women in the restaurant stare at her. All the time, Nick and Poppy ignore them, trying to have a conversation. Everything about this scene screams early 70s to me, from their conversation to the `subtle' look at class. Later in the film, Nick and his goons arrange to meet Mary Ann at the local county fair and collect the money. This sequence is introduced with a series of close ups of a man walking on stilts, children laughing, etc., all meant to disorient the viewer before letting them become familiar with the new setting. Again, very 70s.

There are many sequences in the film which are strange, unusual and interesting, ultimately making the film worth watching. From the opening sequence; Mary Ann's demented brother, Weenie (Gregory Walcott) gets rid of one of the mob's enforcers (perhaps the most memorable scene), to a harvesting machine chasing Nick and Poppy through a corn field, Ritchie seems to be paying homage to Hitchcock and it works. The action scenes are interesting and hold your attention. Even the scene set in the corn field, which is close enough to be called a rip off of the famous chase from Hitchcock's "North By Northwest"; Ritchie adds a little touch at the end to make it memorable and interesting. You won't be able to stop watching it.

When the story turns to more sedate matters and everything relies on the actors, the film is less successful. Marvin seems to have been most comfortable portraying mobsters, generals and cowboys throughout his career. His demeanor is well-suited for these types of roles. He merely has to stare at most men and they will surrender. This persona works well with this character. But when Nick is supposed to be human, it doesn't work. When Nick takes Poppy to dinner, it isn't clear if Nick is trying to romance Poppy or become her supportive "Uncle". She clearly seems to be flirting with him but Nick doesn't seem to return the favor. Thankfully. At this point Marvin was 47 (Wow, he looks older. But I guess he always did.) and Spacek was 22. Not very age appropriate. This scene works if Poppy is flirting with Nick; he has just saved her from a life of prostitution and her life has been pretty screwed up to that point. But it would be creepy to watch Marvin's Nick putting the moves on the younger actress.

Gene Hackman is always interesting to watch. A villain with the name Mary Ann is going to have to be fairly menacing. Hackman follows occasional outbursts with a quick smile or joke, trying to hide his true menace. This performance reminded me exactly of Lex Luthor and makes this character seem all the more like a dry run for the villain he would play in the "Superman" films beginning in 1978.

Sissy Spacek is good, in her first starring role, but the part is a very traditional take on the female sidekick so prevalent in action films. For a great performance, check out her later work in "In The Bedroom".

"Prime Cut" is a memorable exercise in action filmmaking. Two sequences from the film will stay with me for a long time. Can you figure out which ones?

This is a great Lee Marvin classic with lots of pace. Script is excellent and Lee plays his part as the done wrong gangster to the hilt. As good as some of the Dirty Harry movies. Rent it before buying to be on the safe side

What rubbish.  Ridiculous situations, and poor writing doom this boring, stupid film.  Probably, the worst film that starred either Lee Marvin or Gene Hackman.  A real hack job that was meant to snare unsuspecting theater goers who liked the stars

I was looking for the new release of "Point Blank" at my local retail DVD buffet and they didn't have it so, finding "Prime Cut" instead (which I'd never seen) I bought it kind of as a consolation prize; but I was disappointed because I'd been looking for something with the kooky, flashy, noir-weirdness "Point Blank" offered.  

Grudgingly, I popped this in and, within the first few minutes of the movie, I realized that "Prime Cut" is definitely weirder than "Point Blank."  Somehow, I'd forgotten this was a Michael Ritchie film, made just after "Downhill Racer" and just before he really swung in with "The Candidate," "Smile," "The Bad News Bears" and "Semi-Tough."    

We begin with a graphic tour of a slaughterhouse, through which a diced Chicago hood is processed into hot dogs by a guy named Weenie who wouldn't look out of place in the back of a panel of "Sin City."   

Then there are the barnyard pens of wasted, naked sex slaves drooled over by Kansas City moneymen. 

Presiding over it all is a hairy Gene Hackman, chuckling and shoveling hog guts from a plate into his usual sideways grin.

Lee Marvin, looking cut from salmon-toned marble, marches through the whole thing like he's the only character who's already read the script and knows every single decision he needs to make.  

This is a movie that asks us to root against the upstart country boy who defies the mob, to favor the tough-as-railroad-ties mafia enforcer. He wades into the sticks to smack the machine so it'll work right again.  And we do.  

Sure, the movie has it's problems.  There are *lots* of obvious visual metaphors for the way big systems process little things into profitable distortions (none of which trump the slaughterhouse credit sequence).  And the women are mostly helpless, have a tendency to get assaulted but bounce right back at the sight of a shopping bag full of clothes.  The final shoot-out drags a bit during the sunflower field scene.  And, as for the film's signature chase scene -- Marvin and Sissy Spacek flee a gigantic thresher as it chases them across an open wheat field -- I couldn't ignore two thoughts: 1) Why don't they just double-back and run around behind the thing, which cannot easily turn and 2) They could run faster if they weren't holding hands.  

Still, this is a weird, wild, underseen gem, a colorful thriller, almost like an inverted Travis McGee adventure, or like a particularly demented Don Siegel picture.  You (or at least *I*) have to love a crime thriller that takes a five minute time-out while the two main badguys play grabass in a kitchen, wrestling around like teenaged brothers.  This was a movie that made me perfectly happy to temporarily miss "Point Blank."

Though short of classic status, "Prime Cut" has alot to recommend it.  Director Michael Ritchie has a sharp eye for Middle-America ambience and stages some good action set pieces.  Lee Marvin is in classic tough guy form as Devlin, the bagman sent by the Chicago bosses to collect a debt from sleazy Mary Ann(Gene Hackman), whose Kansas City meat plant is a front for a more lucrative trade in white slavery and narcotics.  Hackman, in what is in essence an extended cameo, makes a colorful impression here.  Sissy Spacek, as a girl entrapped in Hackman's operation, isn't really given much to do in her film debut but is easy on the eyes in a fresh-faced kind of way.  The film breezes by at an economical 86 minutes.  Interesting casting here with Gregory Walcott("Plan 9 from Outer Space" infamy) as Hackman's brother and Eddie Egan(the real-life inspiration for Popeye Doyle of "The French Connection" fame) as a Chicago mob boss

Though 'Primary' introduced the political campaigning doco, 'The War Room' surely is the apex of the genre.

Part of the highlight of the doco is Stephanopoulos, who is captured as he is - preening himself and agreeing with others ideas/suggestions.

As with the Clinton campaign, Carville steals the show.  Whatever your convictions (and mine are on the other side of politics) it is impossible not to respect Carville for his character and beliefs.

I dont want to spoil it for you, but Billary wins..

 While I found the glimpses into the inner workings of the 1992 presidential campaign of Bill Clinton to be interesting and well worth watching, it was a bit disappointing. Campaign manager James Carville and Communications Director George Stephanopoulos demonstrate their skills at political maneuvering. Even though Bill Clinton was a masterful politician, these two men got him elected. While both of them show their hard-boiled political fronts, they also show their human sides. Stephanopoulos openly talks about how nervous he is and Carville cries when he thanks the staff for their hard work. 
 There are two main weaknesses to the presentation. The first is that many parts will be incomprehensible to anyone who does not already know a great deal about the events. For example, there is mention of the relationship between Carville and Mary Matalin, but it is never truly explained. The incongruity of the political strategists of Democrat Bill Clinton and Republican George Bush having a romantic relationship in the middle of a presidential campaign is not emphasized as much as it should. If you were not aware of the depth of that relationship and who they are, then that segment will be little more than a flyby.
 The second main weakness is that your perspective never reaches the level of the "fly on the wall." At all times, it is clear that you are seeing into the campaign only to the extent that they want you to see. It would have been better if they at least sometimes made it appear that you were seeing workings of the campaign staff that they would have preferred not be seen. I was especially disappointed with the response to the Gennifer Flowers incident. Clinton and his campaign staff handled it very deftly, yet we really don't see what they did. This contrasts with an incident later in the campaign when Stephanopoulos fields a call from someone who is threatening to expose what they claim is another Clinton infidelity. In this case, he supposedly fathered a child with a black woman. Stephanopoulos tells the person politely but firmly that:

*) At this point no one cares.
*) If you break the story, you will never work in the Democratic party again. 

 I found this video fascinating, but I remembered and understood the events that unfolded. If you for any reason do not know the fundamentals of what is happening, then you will spend a great deal of time puzzled by what you see.

WHAT IS THE WAR ROOM?

What we have here is a glimpse of the behind-the-scenes activities of the Clinton for President election team effort during the 1992 presidential race, centering around "The War Room" [the campaign headquarters]. This documentary begins at the New Hampshire primary and ends with Clinton's victory.

WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?

We are shown the difficulties the Clinton campaign had in dealing with an avalanche of negative press. How they essentially continued effectively implementing their strategic election plan while simultaneously minimizing the damage to Clinton's credibility caused by his emerging image as a draft-dodger and an adulterer is simply amazing to see.

This small epic is quite interesting but knowing how it all ends takes away some of the much deserved suspense and awe. Sure there are scandals for Mr. Clinton and we have the accuser admitting that it was the Republican party that put her up to it. We also have a candidate in Clinton that seemed to have no chance to get the support of his party, let alone win the election. Maybe when the film came out 11 years ago it had more weight. After all this was all one great big surprise and these were current events. However, today my attention went to James Carville who seemed the most genuine and able participant within the war room. We also got a good look at George Stephanopoulos whose presence gave a nice contrast to Carville. I found myself wishing that Carville and Stephanopoulos had been the candidates as they both seemed more sincere and public service oriented than the actual candidates. Naturally it does not work that way, but that is how the film affected me 5 years after the end of the Clinton presidency.

HISTORY AS IT HAPPENED!

This is a true documentary and appears to be fairly objective in depicting how the people who made up the winning political machine in 1992 functioned. This team functioned quite well in overcoming seemingly impossible hurdles which we can now witness as they were happening. In effect, we get to see a rather significant slice of political history as it happened.

SOME FINAL THOUGHTS:

This delightful film is not like "JFK" or some of Michael Moore's films in that it is not fictionalized to entertain and convince at the expense of truth. Charismatic Hollywood actors are never used in place of the real people to foster credibility and empathy. Simply stated, "The War Room" is closer to reality than many of us are use to seeing in film. While it does not have the polish of a "JFK" or the raw emotional impact of a "Fahrenheit 9/11", "The War Room" is much closer to objective truth and therefore extremely worthwhile

The 1992 presidential campaign may seem like eons ago, but "The War Room" brings it all back. The movie focuses on Clinton's aggressive key operatives, in particular the blunt, unconventional James Carville, whose lack of social graces is balanced by a searing intelligence and ruthless political instinct, and the smooth-talking, telegenic George Stephanopoulos. Adding to the drama is the unlikely romance between Carville and Mary Matalin, George Bush the elder's chief campaign adviser. "War Room" is a vivid glimpse into the back-room wheeling and dealing which fuels the modern democratic process.

This is an outstanding documentary of the campaign team that changed presidential campaigning.  One does not need to love the results of these changes (I personally believe that this campaign was the beginning of the end of democracy as we know it, even as I marveled at the talent and loved the outcome of the election) to appreciate how Clinton's 1992 campaign, as seen in this film, changed the American political world. 

"War Room" should be seen along with more recent documentaries (like, for example, "Staffers '04") to see the difference between a campaign that used techniques to achieve a goal and campaigns that use the same techniques as the goal (to be elected rather than to govern).  Hopefully, it will encourage you to do what you can to return political campaigns to discussions of ideas rather than the useless, mind-numbing, dumbing down assessments of candidate traits (like "character" or "integrity") we seem to have resorted to in the past ten years

"The War Room", a film by Chris Hegedus and Da Pennebaker gives you unfettered access to the strategists of the 92' campaign to elect Bill Clinton and Al Gore.  The film doesn't have many appearances by President Clinton or Vice President Al Gore, but that's not the point.  The film shows you just how the campaign was won, the emotions that were felt and the ups and downs of running this campaign.
This film gives you an inside look at the truly revolutionary way in which this historic campaign was won.  
The spotlight is on several star strategists of the Democratic Party such as James Carville, George Stephanopoulos and Paul Begala; all of whom are regulars on CNN's Crossfire.
The film is similar to many other notable documentaries on political campaigns (such as Journeys with George), but the emphasis is on those in charge the campaign, you see into their everyday work lives.  The reason why this film was so successful in it's portrayal of campaigning is: this hadn't been done before.  The film makers were looked at as "friend" not a foe trying to get a story for the evening news.  The film makers are party to strategy meetings and every aspect of the campaign.  
As stated in the DVD introduction, this film's historical significance changes everyday as history and current events change.  It's and excellent film and if you like political documentaries, I suggest you give this a try

I have been in love with the work of Stephen Sondheim since the age of 6, when I first memorized the lyrics to all of the songs from West Side Story.  Mr. Sondheim has give us many, many wonderful pieces of theatre, and several of his best pieces are represented here.

Sweeney Todd: considered by many his masterpiece.  I prefer the Angela Lansbury / George Hearn casting, but if they chose to star Betty Boop and Donald Duck it couldn't hurt this material.  Brilliant.   

Follies in Concert: Follies remains my favorite Sondheim musical and, unlike some other reviewers, I thought the ORIGINAL book was brilliant.  The later revised version considerably weakened both characters and plot, and the "concert" version is even more woefully incomplete than the original cast album, but thank GOD they saw fit to include, "Too Many Mornings".

Sunday In The Park With George: Pulitzer Prize winning paean to the creative process; I can even forgive the casting of Mandy Patinkin, one of my least favorite actors.  The recreation of Seurat's masterpiece during the first act climax still gives me chills.      

Passion: the more I watch this achingly beautiful show, the more I think it's one of Sondheim's greatest scores.  Subtle, yes, but if you allow it to, it will grow and grow on you until you can't get it out of your mind.  This show is for anyone who has ever loved someone that they couldn't have.    

Into The Woods: I saw both Broadway productions and had difficulty choosing which was better.  I think the original cast, represented here, had a slight edge.  Possibly the most "fun" of Sondheim's shows, this take on Grimm's fairy tales is clever, entertaining and highly satisfying.  

The Carnegie Hall tribute is also wonderful.

I have long been of the opinion that Sondheim can do no wrong.  His lyrics are thrillingly brilliant, witty beyond all expectations, and his music contains depth that other Broadway composers can only dream of.  What is most amazing to me is how he can vary styles and musical periods from show to show to show - no two of his musicals are ever alike, which is more than I can say for many other composers.  I don't understand those who like him only to a point; I have friends who love Sweeny, Follies and Night Music, but hate Sunday, Passion and Into the Woods.  I think he gets better with each succeeding show.   

This set is well worth the investment.  Hurry and get it, as some of the individual videos are now unavailable, and who knows how long the boxed set will last.

<review_text>
Sondheim is the master. He is the best of the best.

That said, this is a collection of some of his finest work that exists on DVD.

Follies... while not the most desireable representation of the show (it's very cut down) you still get Barbara Cook's stirring "Losing My Mind," Elaine Stritch's dry and perfect "Broadway Baby," and Carol Burnett's "I'm Still Here," which is a religeous experience. The documentary is quite interesting, as well!

Passion: My favorite Sondheim score. The music is lush and beautiful. The characters are real and fascinating. The dialogue is poetry. It's an amazing show with an amazing score, and amazing performances given by amazing actors. 

Sunday in the Park: Anyone with any interest in art of any form should see this musical. It's a wonderful look at the creation of art and the process of creating. It has a strong message of finding "something new, something of your own." This is a strong, powerful musical about going against the odds for the sake of art, and not giving the masses what they want (something Sondheim does marvelously and brilliantly).

Sweeney Todd: The greatest musical ever written. It's about murder and cannibalism. Well, the plot, at least. The show is about revenge and love and obsession and all of this is reflected so beautifully in the amazingly huge score. To hear this score played by a Symphony orchestra, sung by an opera ensemble and with such a fantastic mix of opera and musical theatre stars is heaven. George Hearn IS Sweeney Todd, and Patti LuPone recreates Mrs. Lovett as her own with brilliant acting and singing. Neil Patrick Harris, Lisa Vroman, Standford Olsen also bring magic and beauty to this production.

Celebration at Carnegie Hall: Such a loving mix of well-known and obscure Sondheim performed by the best. Too many highlights to name, and wonderful new arrangements. Any Sondheim fan should own this, and anyone who watches it will soon be a Sondheim fan. This concert shows why he is considered the greatest musical theatre composer of the 20th century (and in my opinion, ever)

Happy Christmas!  Wow.  Somebody loves me.  What a spectaular gift.  Each of these shows is a gem.  The concert offers Madeline Kahn singing &amp;quot;Getting Married Today&amp;quot; (I just adored her).  The Sondheim/Lapine shows are three of the masters best efforts - &amp;quot;Sunday in the Park,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Into the Woods&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Passion.&amp;quot;  Great performances on each of these discs - Bernadette Peters, Mandy Patinkin, Donna Murphy, Marin Mazzie, Glenn Close, Comedn and Green, Elaine Stritch and Barbara Cook - and many more.  Anyone who loves the musical theatre would be thrilled and delighted to have this collection

 would rate the show as 5 stars, this is a review of the extras and features of the Special Edition issue.
I recently bought all the Special Edition releases of "Stand Alone Complex" after trying to research what I was going to get as extras not included in the regular edition. I found the listings on Amazon's product details to be a little confusing and incomplete on some of the volumes so I decided to write this guide for others trying to decide. I'm not going to review the "Ghost in the Shell" episodes or the series in general because there are so many excellent reviews already on this site, and most of you probably know about this great anime TV series already. There are various other reviews that say that some of the DVD's and CD's have errors on them and Bandai will replace them with corrected discs if you send them in for exchange. I have not ran into problems yet, although I haven't gone through the whole series either. And I will also state that I love the TV series as well as both movies, but I would recommend the Imported Region 2 version of GITS2:Innocence if you have a region free DVD player. Dreamworks really messed up that release omiting the English dub and putting Hard of Hearing subtitles instead of regular ones on the early issues of that movie. Most people find them very distracting and annoying.

First off the discs themselves, you get two DVD discs in each volume with the same episodes on both discs. Volumes 1-5 have 4 episodes each, 6 and 7 have 3 episodes each making 26 episodes total in the series. Both discs are Anamorphic wide screen encoded directly from the High-Definition Masters. Both Discs also have English subtitles. Each set also has two interviews with voice cast or someone associated with the production of the anime, and a printed DVD insert pamphlet or booklet with different interviews and such for each volume. All discs are Region 1.

Disc one has Dolby Digital 5.1 in Japanese and English, and Dolby Digital 2.0 in English and Japanese.

Disc two has DTS 5.1 in English and Japanese and a Dolby Digital 2.0 English track.

Volumes 1 and 2 include soundtrack CD's of the music of Yoko Kanno, the most excellent and versatile composer of the music in the TV series. Anime lovers know her work from the many fine soundtracks that she's done for countless other anime movies and TV series.

Volume 3 has a Black XL Fruit of the Loom Tee-Shirt with the section 9 logo on the front and a Major Kusanagi graphic on the back. Nice shirt!

Volumes 4 and 5 have a collectable I.D. cards for a section 9 member.

Volume 6 has a Black XL Fruit of the Loom Tee-Shirt with the section 9 logo on the front and a Batou graphic on the back, and another I.D. card. Nice shirt again!

Volume 7 has another Tee-Shirt! This time it's a White XL with the section 9 logo on the front, and the Laughing Man logo on the back! Once again nice shirt! It also comes with a tin box that's supposed to hold all 7 volumes of the DVD set. I was excited about getting the box but when it arrived I was disappointed with the design. It's kind of like the rectangular lunch box that you used to take to school as a kid, without the handle and latch. Its also of a thinner metal that dents easily. It has marketing type of printing on the backside that pertains to vol. 7 only, and the DVD cases stack inside one on top of the other. The spines of the cases are not visible when you open the box, only the front of the last case you put in. So you have to take all the cases out of the tin to get to a specific volume. There's also not room for the cardboard sleves that the DVD's were in when you got the individual volumes, and no room for the soundtrack CD's either. All said, I was disappointed with the box. Because of it's odd dimensions it doesn't stack in well with my DVD library. I would have much preferred the normal five sided box that usually comes with DVD sets.

Overall I'd say it's worth it to buy volumes 3, 6 and 7 new to get the shirts if they interest you and pick up the others used if you can to save some money on the series. That is if you're interested in the DTS soundtrack options. I much prefer the DTS mixes to Dolby Digital and wanted the soundtrack CD's as well. Also the cardboard boxes that come with volumes 3 and 6 are better than the tin box to store your set in when you complete the series, if you stack them on shelves one row of DVD's on top of another row, and you can fit the movies into those boxes as well to fill them the rest of the way

I'll admit to you that I love to watch Adult Swim, and I'll also admit that I like certain types of anime. No, I'm not one of those nerdy card-trading Poke'mon lovers, I'm a young adult who likes to use my imagination in my down time. I like anime that's made for adults like: Big O!, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Outlaw Star, Tenchi and Ghost in the shell. 

I was watching either watching Family Guy or Aqua Teen Hunger Force when I saw previews for this show start to air on Adult Swim, I thought thought it looked cool, it featured what looked to me like a cool futuristic take on robots and the humans that are seamlessly integrated with cybornetics to make them almost immortal, But I didn't know the half of it. 

What I got was a cyber-punk version of the old black-and-white film noir mysteries. The series receives its subtitle from a theoretical mental complex attributed to the adaptation of cybernetics into the mass public. In the story, 'stand alone complex' is said to describe copies with no original and is portrayed by copycat crimes with no original criminal, or in other words, an imaginary criminal. It also refers to the structure of each episode: Each episode can be viewed independently of each other, and there is little catch-up (if at all) given in each episode to keep the viewer up to date. 

Taking place in a fictional city of Japan called "Niihama-shi" (New Port City) in the year 2030, Stand Alone Complex tells the story of a special operations task-force called Public Security Section 9, or simply "Section 9". The series follows the exploits of Section 9's agents who range from ex-military to ex-police as they address each case and how it affects them on a personal level, eventually leading to the mysterious figure dubbed by the media as "The Laughing Man". 

Public Security Section 9 is an elite domestic anti-crime unit tasked with the charge of preemptive prevention of technology-related acts of terrorism and crime. Their duties include response to serious cyber crimes (i.e. Cyberbrain hacking, cyber-terrorism), investigation of unlawful acts of those in public office and of high profile murder cases. From time-to-time they also serve as protection to foreign VIPs. 

If you have seen the movie then you know that the TV series differs from the cinema adaptation in its focus upon issues created by the advance of technology. Instead of the intensely focused and personal examination of technology, presented is a look at society and technology as a larger whole. The series of 26 half-hour TV episodes has a larger budget of time to explore the concepts and ideas found in the original manga. In comparison to the film version, the series is considered by many to be easier to understand. Also, in comparison, the series can be found to be closer to the manga; due to the presence of some humor, the usage of the Tachikomas (Fuchikomas in the manga, and referred to simply as "tanks" in the one scene a derivant version makes an appearance in), the design of the characters, and also, the usage of the characters Paz, Bouma and Saito. Stand Alone Complex exhibits the accumulated experience and expertise of Production I.G. in their application of computer generated imagery. This is evident in their digital color grading, environmental effects, and cell-shaded computer models. Their work has been highly praised for its subtle contribution to a scene, which adds greatly to the atmosphere. 

I think a lot of people will try to compare this to Cowboy Bebop as with so many other anime and mangas, but that's foolish. Stand Alone Complex is no better or worse than Cowboy Bebop, it's just a different story, different style, different sets of charactors and there places. 

if you like anime or manga you'll definitely like this show. It's complex, has views on modern terrorism and how to deal with it, and not to mention the technology! Even if you don't watch anime just give a chance and take it for what it is.

I've heard a lot of complaints about the storyline, and a lot of complaints about how the DVDs are sold and the number of episodes...

The story is very complex, it is.  There's no getting around it.  Even the Japanese feel that it's complex, and have you had a good look at their written language lately?  I for one love the series, and I'm a big fan of Production IG's work, and Masamune Shirow-sensei's work, especially his more well-known works; Koukaku Kidoutai (Ghost in The Shell), and Appleseed.

As for the price of the DVDs and the number of episodes, I'm a fan of DVDs having fewer episodes, or atleast using as much of the disc as possible.  I compared my Japanese DVDs with my American ones and found something startling;  The Japanese DVDs, which have just 2 episodes, and cost roughly $60 US, utilize more than 7gb of the disc.  The American DVD which has 4 episodes, English audio, and sells for $20-45 (Depending on edition) uses a hair over 6gb.  Are you being ripped off? Yes.  Is it because of the number of episodes? No.

A 26 episode series has to be something like 5-5-5-5-3-3, or 5-5-4-4-4-4, or in this case 4-4-4-4-4-3-3, otherwise the last volume would have a very small number of episodes.  And THAT they cannot sell.  Personally, I wish they'd just put all the extras on the last disc, because then the DTS disc would be irrelevant, the normal disc could have DTS.  But I'm willing to bet the average American consumer would still pitch a fit over a DVD with just 1-2 episodes and a bunch of interviews.

If you want to feel ripped off, don't do it because of the way the episodes are distributed, feel ripped off because they're putting 4 episodes on the DVD and still fail to use more disc space than the Japanese 2-episode DVDs.  Which is a ridiculous thing, since once you break the 4.5gb mark, whether you use 4.51gb or 8.5gb it still costs the same amount to manufacture, so why didn't they fill the disc?  This, while not a 'lack' of bandwidth, still leads to lowered visual quality in comparison to the original Japanese DVDs.

Oh, and if you still want to complain about the price, note the fact that the Japanese DVDs are around $60 and only have 2 episodes.  Kinda puts things in perspective, doesn't it?  (Yes, that means that this series is 13 volumes in Japan...26 if you count the second season.

With this DVD, Stand Alone Complex returns completely to the story arc at its core - the Laughing Man.  With Togusa out of commission, the rest of section 9 focuses on finding the real culprits behind the attack on the Sunflower Society - The Ministry of Health.  All three of the episodes here chip away at the truth but we will find little satisfaction in knowing the names.  No sooner is a witness discovered, but he is killed, and the trail of corruption leads to the highest levels of government.

This is the classic paranoid plot.  More than one player makes the mistake of believing that there is some honor among thieves and faces elimination.  The Ministry of Health is ruthless and heavily armed (as Major Kusanagi discovers), assassins lurk everywhere, and even Aramaki falls afoul of a plot.  Gradually the entire ugly story of the intentional suppression of a treatment for cyberbrain sclerosis for a technology that is ineffective but makes a fortune for the politicians behind the scenes.

This is a dark story.  Without the actions of the Laughing Man no one would know that hundreds are due to die in agony to line the pockets of a political movement that will stop at nothing to increase its power,  With no evidence Section 9 seems condemned to making desperate attempts to find a witness who will stay alive long enough to testify.  And without that witness their hands are tied.

Unlike the earlier Laughing Man episodes, the story has remained coherent from the moment that Togusa finds the paper report.  Despite an intricate plot, the level of action stays high and there are a few real surprises for the viewer - it's not just the enemy who can be sneaky.  With three more episodes to go, there's a lot of room for even more plot twists

I've been wondering how a 26-episode series could be completed with 4-episode installments.
Now, in retrospect, it all seems sadly obvious.  Just put only 3 episodes on each of the last 2 discs... and CHARGE THE SAME PRICE!
[sound of metallic breathing] DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF THE DARK SIDE!!!

On the positive side, I guess the reason is that all three episodes on this chapter are of the "Complex" variety and thus considerably advance the Laughing Man storyline.  Don't get me wrong.  This is a great chapter of Stand Alone Complex, highlighted by a scene in which the Laughing Man pulls someone's proverbial butt out of the proverbial fire.
If there's a weak part of this installment, it's the sequence with the "Armored Suit", which for some unknown reason goes back and yet again rips off elements of the big fight at the end of the first GITS film, just as the "Testation" episode had done several installments back. The armored exoskeleton could have been used to greater effect.
By the end of this installment, almost the entire shape and design of the Laughing Man plot seems clear.  It is interesting to learn from the special features that the Murai vaccine plot was originally meant to be stand-alone material

Hey, does anyone know how I can get the original version of this movie? That starts out with a long view of the sub barracks, gives a glimpse of Baldwin meeting Connery at an embassy party in DC, builds up the radiation badge issue, and so on.  I must have seen this movie before they trimmed it down for broad issue.  "Directors cut" does not appear to have this.  Any ideas?

As we all know, it's a great movie no matter what edition we view

This is one of my all time favorites in the acton adventure category.  It really is a must see about submarines.  It is just really a stimulating movie.  It is so much better than a bond movie and I love bond

This is a highly entertaining film with an incredibly minimalist screenplay that succeeds beyond all expectations. This film's strengths are its characters and the actors that portray them. Sean Connery plays Captain Marko Ramius with great bravado and charisma relying greatly on his mesmerizing screen presence to maneuver the entire direction of this film. Tim Curry is amusing as the dutiful Dr. Petrov in a role well suited for him. The rest of the cast balances out the histrionics of Sean Connery and Tim Curry with realistic and convincing performances to bring authenticity and realism to the drama of this film. Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan, James Earl Jones as Admiral James Greer, Sam Neill as Captain Vasily Borodin, Scott Glenn as Commander Bart Mancuso, Richard Jordan as Dr. Jeffrey Pelt and an impressive Peter Firth as Political Officer Ivan Putin bring a needed sense of pragmatism to their collective roles to bolster the dramatics and emotion of the story. This was probably one of Alec Baldwin's best performances and he truly conducts himself in the manner that the character of Jack Ryan should have been portrayed. Baldwin perfectly conveyed the analytical mind that the character of Jack Ryan embodied. Sam Neill is also brilliant as the dedicated officer who also possesses a very human side that perhaps puts him in conflict with carrying out his duties to the full extent of his country's political dictates and ambitions. Sam Neill has a wonderful role in this regard and he plays it flawlessly. I liked Scott Glenn's character immensely as the US Commander who truly has to rely on his instincts and his logical interpretation of facts and events to face what is put before him. The list of performances goes on but the point is that portrayal of these characters and how they think and conduct themselves is at the heart of this film. Their efforts make this film a great political, action-adventure and emotional drama.

One of the last great films of the Cold War era made around the time the Berlin Wall fell. The hunt for Red October is classic intrigue and tension of the USSR and USA over dominion of geopolitics. Sean Connery brings back the cool and intense demeanor that made him famous as the original James Bond

<review_text>
"Central Intelligence Agency," Captain Bart Mancuso growls, descending a ladder in his sub, "Now there's a contradiction in terms."

He is about to match wits with a wily Russian sub commander, played stoically and well by Sean Connery, who is trying to surrender his ship to the Americans, "a ship with only one purpose." The Red October is the pride of the Soviet fleet, its newest and biggest - and with the newest toy; a caterpillar drive, equipped to travel through the water nearly silently and almost impossible to detect. Connery's Captain Ramius - I was almost ready to believe that Lithuanians -Ramius is supposed to be Lithuanian - speak Russian with a Scots accent - has had enough Cold War in his life and wants to make sure he can level the playing field as he leaves, or die trying. Enter into the mix Jack Ryan, a young analyst for the CIA and a student of Russian sub commanders, Ramius in particular.  I was always sorry Alec Baldwin did not reprise his role in the next Jack Ryan vehicle; I thought he brought a sense of urgency and brilliance to the role that Harrison Ford - don't get me wrong, I think he's good too - lacks- and I always thought Ford was too old for the part anyway. Baldwin had just the right touch, for the first movie. The camaraderie and mutual respect between his character and James Earl Jones' Admiral Greer is obvious; they know each other well, and trust each other's judgment.

Recruited by Greer to convince a boardroom of military advisors on the sudden and mysterious naval activity in the North Sea, which is known to center around the new sub Red October,Ryan succeeds in selling the President's main advisor on what he thinks is going on - he's correctly surmised that Ramius wants to defect. Trusting that Ramius has already figured out the worst parts and has a plan  worked out, the advisor Pelt delegates Ryan to go out and intercept the sub before the Russian fleet chasing him gets close enough to eliminate him.

There are excellent supporting roles - Scott Glenn, as Capt. Mancuso, spent time aboard an actual working naval sub to get the authenticity of his part, and he is superb. Until I watched the extras on the DVD I was unaware that Larry Ferguson, who plays Chief Watson on Mancuso's sub, had a lot to do with writing the screenplay; I liked him before that, but knowing that added another dimension. It doesn't get any better than the aforementioned James Earl Jones; and also good, in smaller roles, are Courtney Vance, Sam Neill, and the lesser Russian officers that make up Ramius's elite cadre of expatriots.

In contrast to what's been going on the last few years, the Cold War seems almost genteel in its menace. I could almost look back on it with nostalgia. Almost. This movie reminds us that things are never going to be easy or without cost, no matter what method of persuasion is employed. I cannot recommend this movie highly enough. I know parts of it by heart

What a superb cold-war action flick.  It has an all-star cast, all male, and many who became stars later.  Sean Connery is Captain Ramius of the new super sub "Red October".  His stature is legendary among all Soviet submarine captains, but his is Lithuanian and his wife has died a year earlier while he was at sea.  He has no children.  The officer crew of the sub was hand picked by him and are almost all men who are personally loyal to him.

Jack Ryan here is played by Alec Baldwin in one of his best roles.  He is a brilliant CIA analyst rather than a field officer and knows submarines.  Because of what develops, he is brought in by CIA Chief Admiral Greer (the immortal and national treasure James Earl Jones) to advise the National Security Advisor Pelt (the wonderful and too soon lost Richard Jordan).  There is a great deal of confusion between what the Americans, the Soviets, and the various crews of various ships know.  We, the audience, know the actual situation, but we are concerned about who will learn what before or after it is too late.

What I like most about this movie is that while there are some heroics, they aren't the superman kind of stunts that show up in too many action flicks.  People try to do what they have to do and it doesn't always work out without a cost or even all that well.  In the end, well, you already know or should watch the movie to find out.

I do want to single out the terrific Courtney Vance as the sonar genius Jones, Scott Glenn as Commander Mancuso of the US sub Dallas and Sam Neill as the Soviet Captain Borodin - 2nd to Ramius.  Fine performances from each.  Even though the ships are big, shooting a movie in such confined quarters risks tedium and claustrophobia (which can work for a film if handled well).  This film focuses in on faces and shows us people talking in small groups so we can see the emotion on their faces as they struggle to understand what is going on and what should happen next.

Enjoy

The thing I remember most about this film when I saw it in the theater in 1990 was its honesty. On every level. Great care was taken to accurately depict one particular community at one particular time--when AIDS was first being diagnosed as "the gay cancer," up through the mid-eighties, when attending monthly funerals was commonplace for gay men and their friends. Though HIV/AIDS had been around for a decade when this movie was made, there was no effort on the part of the filmmakers to whitewash the past. They not only show the ugliness of the disease, they show the ugliness of people's response to it. Even within the gay community there was a tendency for people to fingerpoint, accusing the first victims of being more promiscuous than themselves, or more excessive users of amyl nitrate and recreational drugs. There was fear of contamination, reluctance to touch or kiss, and even intimacy within monogomous relationships was hampered. People reached deperately for New Age cures, and Louise Haye was the reigning goddess of self-healing. By choosing to depict a five-year period, the filmmakers allow the viewer to see the lives of a group of friends evolve and deepen. Some of course succumb to the disease and die, others wrestle with their losses and rethink their lives. In the end, the survivors try to become part of the solution; they become visiting volunteers and political activists. For all its authenticity, the film is not depressing. This is incredible ensemble acting at its best. Campbell Scott, Bruce Davison, and Mark Lamos give especially moving performances, but there are no slackers in this cast.

By the time the movie was released, the face of AIDS was already changing and the filmmakers were criticized for focusing exclusively on gay victims. I felt then, and I continue to believe, this is a misplaced criticism. All fiction is self-limited. LONGTIME COMPANION is the story of one small group of friends who are affected by an unknown and dreadful disease; and it shows how each of them responds to the challenges thrown at them. Yes, they were wealthy or middle-class white men who spent summers together on Fire Island. But LONGTIME COMPANION is not a celebration of their insular lives. In fact, by the end of the film, one of this insular group, Campbell Scott's character, is shown working as a home care volunteer who visits a Latino man. I think the filmmakers, like GMHC at the time, were aware that things were starting to change. It seems to me that the film's critics, even in 1990, had forgotten that AIDS was first announced in the New York Times as "gay cancer" and later as "Gay Related Immune Deficiency Syndrome" before being called AIDS. But that said, we need to remember that there are many other people's stories that are worth telling, including those of people living and coping with AIDS in Africa. My only hope is that these stories will be told with all the accuracy and sensitivity that went into the making of LONGTIME COMPANION.

The DVD has no significant "extras," but the transfer is excellent

There are a great many gay themed films available today, but when Longtime Companion was released, it was but one of a small handful of films brave enough to paint gay characters with empathetic and intelligent brushstrokes - something that continues to beset filmmakers even today. 

Set during the late 70's and on into the 80's the film is a bare bones and ruthlessly truthful before-and-after portrait of the devastating effects of the AIDS virus on a small group of close friends/lovers and on the wider gay community. Very funny, extremely moving, occasionally upsetting, whether you are a gay viewer or not, this film is a courageous celebration of the strength and frailty of the human spirit.

This film is a wonder for many reasons: beautiful performances, sharp writing and directing, and SAD.  When I first saw this - the sobbing in the theater was so intense that I thought I'd have to build an ark to get home.  Now, Longtime Companion is still all of those things but a little dated.  Advances in medicine haved moved us to a point where AIDS is not an immediate death sentence.  Watching this film years later it does play a bit like "And Then There Were None"  - but it still works.  Watch it and remember if you lived through that era, watch it and be greatful if you did not

I saw the Broadway musical about 5 years ago and after seeing the movie and purchasing the DVD, I think that everyone should see this movie over and over again.  Chris Columbus has done a wonderful job bringing this musical to film and keeping Jonathan Larson's ideals and thought-provoking view and dreams alive.  The actors are first rate!  They each have their own unique style and their voices are remarkable.  
I am happy to have the deleted scenes as a bonus in the DVD.  I wish that Chris had kept "Goodbye Love" in the film, but thank god we have a chance to see it. It is a scene that has to be seen by all! 
The documentary on the Disc 2 is something I am privleged to have watched and I'm so happy to now know how Jonathan Larson lived his life.
No day but today!!

Not following the recent Broadway scene very much, I wasn't really aware of what a sensation "Rent" was several years ago when it debuted. I became more aware of it when it was satirized in the Southpark picture "Team America" and after my church intergenerational choir sang the show's "theme" song "Seasons of Love". Then one of the kids that I worked with in a local musical said Rent was one of his favorites, so I was a first-weekend attendee at the theatre. The story is important as it depicts gays, lesbians, drag queens and drug addicts as real people struggling with life, love (and AIDS) just like so-called "normal" people. Being in the rock style, the songs aren't necessarily "toe-tappers" that you end up whistling on the way out of the theatre (though "Seasons of Love" comes close, particularly if you've sang it at least two dozen times, and "La Vie Boheme" is a showstopper--the plot is supposedly based on the opera of that name), but overall the music is very exciting and integral to the story. The cast moved almost en masse from Broadway to Hollywood--Wilson Heredia, a Tony winner as drag queen Angel, should have contended for an Oscar as Supporting Actor. I've read that there was some concern about mainstream Hollywood director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Harry Potter I and II) getting the job, but I don't see that the picture suffered for it--maybe some unconvincing special effects are the worst of it. As a rock opera, it takes some time to get used to having almost all the dialogue sung rather than spoken. Overall another solid four star film----definitely recommended to fans of modern musicals, to those in marginalized communities, and to those with art in their souls.

P.S.  Afterwards I got hooked on the soundtrack CD for a few weeks (months?) but that's another review

I borrowed this movie for the first time a few weeks ago and after reading the reviews about it, I wasn't quite sure how I would feel about it. After watching it, I have to say that I LOVE this movie and bought it the next day. Regardless of what critics have written, I loved that they were able to get most of the original cast members to play the roles that made RENT a success. Yes, they are supposed to be in their 20's in the play but really, I barely noticed or frankly, could've cared less.  I love Jesse L. Martin and he was fantastic. Idina Menzel's voice is super and was ever surprised that Rosario Dawson could sing. Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Wilson Jermaine Heredia and Tracie Thoms were great as well. Yes they changed and omitted things that are in the Broadway play, but if you are truelly a fan of RENT, you will overlook that and just enjoy the one thing that is always present: the wonderful songs!

I absolutely love this film. It is one of the best ever. I have been dying to see it on Broadway, but haven't been able to. It's so hard to anyways with Broadway being so expensive. But the film is amazing.

The original cast of the broadway show - save for two - are in this film and it's great. I love that they brought alumni back that have actually been in the play and could really, and I mean, really know how these characters are. It's a great film.

It brings a new light to those that haven't heard of the show before. And it brings about so many different issues that have been such a big part of our culture. AIDS, lesbians, gays, druggies. And it's just a great film. I related to Mark the most, because of how he loves to film things. I think that there is a "RENT" character for everyone!

I give the movie a 10 out of 10!!!

I have to say...I was a little weary when i decided to see this movie...alot of my friends raved about it, but im so picky, i didnt think id like it. so i watched it and i was blown away. i cried the first few times i saw it. I must've watched it about 10-20 times and i can never get enough.

it is beautifully done. the music is excellent. the casting was clear perfection. i give props to the writer of the original play...what a masterpiece

i could rave forever and ever about it. the storyline is such like todays life...paying rent sucks, and its nearly impossible to get good money around here. 

i could rant and rave for hours. all i have to say is, if you havnt seen it, it is a must for anyone over the age of around 15...the topics can get a little mature. but it really is worth it

I am very surprised at the negative reviews for this film. I never saw the Broadway musical on which the movie was based, so I don't have the advantage of having the live performance to compare to the movie. I have to say that the film really touched me, and I generally haven't liked most of the recent musical films that I've seen. All of the songs in Rent have heavy and deep meanings behind them since there's hardly any spoken dialogue. This means that Rent moves forward on the strength of its songs. Each number furthers the plot and reveals another aspect of a character. 

Playwright Jonathan Larson was an amazing human being with such a talent for - at the time he wrote it back in the early 90's - being so "out there" and taking the risk of writing about AIDS and homosexuality, and ultimately having his work find its way into the hearts of so many people. If you wrote an actual script in which the young author of such a wildly successful Pulitzer winning musical dies the night after its dress rehearsal after being misdiagnosed by two different hospitals, nobody would believe you, but that is exactly what happened. It is also a shame that the actual reality of life in Alphabet City (now very much gentrified) and the nature of the AIDS crisis and treatments have changed so much that many people might not consider this film's greatness because they will regard it as out of date. I guess I just found the movie to be brilliant because it wasn't supposed to be absolutely realistic, it was supposed to evoke emotion, and that it did, at least for me. None of the individual relationships get that much screen time, yet I really cared deeply about all of these characters, both as a group and individually. 

You could really feel the urgency of time pressing on the characters that had AIDS - the urgency to create, the urgency to love, - since, in 1990, there were not a lot of therapies that effectively prevented HIV from turning into full blown AIDS as there are today. Also, if you are not moved by Collins' tribute to Angel in the reprise performance of "I'll Cover You", all I can say is that you have no soul. Jesse Martin does a splendid job of displaying a genuine sense of loss, grief, and love that is the best performance in the entire movie.

Rent is one of those few films that I like to watch over and over just to see if I have missed anything. It does seem like some of the movie's detractors are being a bit snobby about the fact that Chris Columbus, who is well known for directing family films, directed this movie. Unfortunately, Bob Fosse is no longer with us, because I have found myself wondering more than once what he would have done with this material.

Way too much money was put into the movie.  The cast is way too old.  It completely lost all of the grittiness and the pain of the play.  It's very unfortunate that there was an opportunity to immortalize one of the great landmarks of the contemporary musical theatre and this is all we ended up with

To me, The Office is one of those shows that people either love or hate. This past summer I became familiar with the show by catching the reruns of the 2nd season on NBC. After watching just one full episode, I was hooked. I continued to tune in each week to watch the reruns and ended up buying season 1 a few weeks later. I watched that DVD repeatedly and decided that I had to buy the 2nd season as soon as it was available on DVD. I've watched both seasons a countless number of times. The episodes never stop being funny no matter how many times you watch them. At least that's how it is in my case. I know most of the people who will read this review will have probably already seen the show and might be as big of a fan of it as I am, but I cannot express enough what an amazing show this is. The writing and the comedic timing are beyond words. I hope to see this show last for at least 5 seasons.  

Standout episodes from Season 2(in my opinion):
The Dundies
The Client
Christmas Party
The Injury
The Secret
Michael's Birthday
Drug Testing
Casino Night

That was REALLY hard to choose because all of the episodes are amazing.

If you've liked even one of "The Office" TV episodes, you'll want to be enjoying this CD -- thus avoiding those disruptive commercials.  Carried along by the excellent acting skills of the entire cast, you'll experience the pains and the passions of these familiar personality types.  This is "reality TV" that's more real than reality itself

I knew I loved The Office before I bought Season Two, but I didn't realize just how much. I've watched every episode so many times, and I'm not even close to being sick of them. The commentaries are so brilliant and involve so many of the actors and writers and producers and others from the creative team of this show. I've learned so much about the show in general, as well as the specific writing decisions they've made, and the actors' choices and thoughts on how certain scenes turned out. The extras like the bloopers and the PSAs are so wonderful as well. This is one of the best purchases I've made in a while

This is hands down the best comedy on tv right now.  The office uses intelligent humor, an excellent mix of characters to bring about some extremely funny situations and stories.  Set in a small town and a mid-sized paper company, the manager is clueless when it comes to business but very charasmatic and lovable.  His ignorance creates somve very memorable situations.
i recommend this item for anyone who like humor that does not involve children hitting each other with trash cans

This DVD set of the second season was wonderful! It contains the complete shows plus deleted scenes from each episode. It also features commentaries on select shows, where the episode plays out and the actors and writers talk about what was going on in the moment, etc. This is in the bonus features, which also includes bloopers and fake P.S.A.'s and other gems. I highly recommend this if you are an Office fan, and if you aren't, get on board for cryin' out loud! It's an awesome show!!

The Pick-up Artist is a dangerously bad film. There is absolutely no chemistry between Robert Downey and Molly Ringwald. Molly Ringwald may have been of the most iconic 1980's female actresses, and she certainly proves her worth here. Ringwald looks too much of a virgin to me when her character wasn't supposed to be. That marks the moment when the film had lost its believably element. The real joke in this film has to be Robert Downey. His acting is insanely moronic. I often have to wonder if he wears a lipstick. I am pretty sure Robert Downey can make a great drag queen if he chose to. From the start to the end, I was annoyed. I couldn't see how Dennis Hopper and Danny Aiello got interested in this film and lend their hands in it. Harvey Keitel gives a fair performance, but I believe he is much tougher than that. Comparing Harvey Keitel's performance in Bad Lieutenant, Reservoir Dogs, and Mean Streets to The Pick-up Artist, it is enough to make an apparent observation that Harvey Keitel should have applied his talents to a more different film than this. A smaller film that he did rightfully apply his talent was Rising Sun, and he pulled that one off better than he did in this film. Why did they have to call it The Pick-up Artist? Could they give the movie a better title such as The Player

this movie is a romantic tale of a young man who wants to be the best salsa dancer *in the world pretty much. it's kind of cheesy and corny, but the dancing in the film is superb.  the main character is a buff, good looking guy with a jerry curl *hehe* i guess that was cool during the time the movie was made! he is overprotective of his sister... blah blah, she goes out with his friend and he is against it but realizes that he is being stupid and goes on to become a great dancer. good watch for those of you into movies such as dirty dancing and llambada

I first watched this movie when I was 7 years old, with my Mom, here in Croatia. Never have I imagined I would be able to buy it and watch it so many years after, especially since I have been dancing my whole life and salsa for the last 2 years. The words cannot express how I felt watching this movie and reliving the passion I feel every time I step on the dance floor. Yes, it's an 80's movie and yes, the acting could have been better. But that was how the music and salsa were interpreted back then I if it was any different, it would be disappointing. The lovestory is nicely incorporated in the movie, which is full of strong, bold salsa moves. Robby Rosa is absolutely fantastic and was the best choice for this role. The appearance of Celia Cruz, the Queen of Salsa, and Tito Puente shows that the makers of the movie wanted to show salsa in all its variety - from classical (Celia Cruz) to hip and modern (Chicos Y Chicas) because salsa can be danced to any music. It comes from the heart, and this movie shows it in the best possible way.

I love this movie!! I remember the first time I saw it, I was about 6-7 yrs.old, on a plane &amp; on my way to Puerto Rico.  Eighteen (or so) years later, I bought it &amp; watched it with my family, it brought back so many great memories, We loved it all over again. I love the music, the dancing &amp; the actors/actresses, The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because IT IS AN 80's MOVIE!  We all know how 80's dance movies  have the bad fame of neing CORNY!  I have to admit, it did have some corny and bad acting moments, but all in all, I think this is an amewome movie, I love it &amp; recommend it

Salsa is a brilliant movie - one of the best movies with no major plot.  There is fantastic music and great dancing and a hot guy - what more could you want.
Rico (Robby Rosa and Menudo) wants to win a dance competition that will take him to Puerto Rico.  He's also the older and over protective brother to Rita and when she starts dating his best friend Ken, he goes nuts when he finds out (they keep their relationship secret for a while).  Will this ruin his chance of winning the dance comp?
As I said earlier, there is fantastic music in this movie.  Margarita and Under My Skin are the best.  The actual scene when they play Margarita is fantastic.  It's a now dated movie, but it is still a favourite of mine that I do watch over and over again still.  I love it and any fan of dance movies should love it to - especially if you like that latin flavour

I purchased both DVD's of The French Chef. Both are equally enjoyable and bring back a different time when we didn't have "food celebraties" but just Julia. Still informative and interesting along with the combination of her irreverance and humor make these DVD's a must have whether the viewer enjoys cooking or not

With many of the early episodes &amp; recipes included, this DVD is a delight.  Watching Julia's aplomb as things go wrong is reassuring to anyone who has had a kitchen disaster.  Though I doubt that I'll cook the tripe, some of the other recipes look worth tackling.

I knew I would love learning from Julia's shows and see lots of techniques but I had no idea how hilarious these shows are.  Julia has a dry humor and a delightful way of handling mishaps but the burned french onion soup and the tart that flipped out of the pan and onto the counter were the best!!  No one on the food network would let you see how to do this part of cooking.  I'm too young to have seen the shows first hand so there are all new to me.  Julia said in an interview once that she always considered herself a cooking teacher and she is.  The dish being prepared is just the vehicle to teach about everything from how to shop for food to how important it is to keep your area clean and tidy.  And did you know that apples must be stirred with a "purple spoon?"  Everything that I make from these DVDs is great and has become a kitchen regular.  I recommend them for entertainment, education and a good laugh

These DVDs are pure and uninterrupted Julia.  No awkward introductions or montages--just JC.  However, the episodes are jumbled and skip from the first episodes to later ones in the seventies---but no dates! so the only way to divine their sequence is by her clothing and hairstyle.  Honestly--wouldn't it have been more effective to showcase her progression as a TV personality by revealing her episodes to us just as the public saw them

Like others, I remember the fascination with watching Julia Child on public television as a kid in the 70's, and even beyond (I think it was on cable sometime within the last decade). Recently I felt compelled to purchase this. I own the book "In Julia Child's Kitchen" which most of the recipes for the color TV shows are found, and I had fond memories. I was not disappointed! In fact, I plan to purchase Volume 2. I love the way the discs are divided into appetizers, etc., main courses and desserts. So much information here. Each show is a full 30 minutes. I love how Julia throws other information in along the way (such as the French Onion Soup show where she goes into detail about sharpening and caring for knives). Such a warm and wonderful personality, she is always humourous, never condescending. It is funny to watch things "not quite" turn out as planned, and she goes with it. It is a joy to watch!
My only disappointment is that there's not a "Volume 3." There are SO MANY of these shows available, I hope WGBH in Boston will release them in time. (One that I REALLY wish they would release on DVD is the Chicken Breast show which featured Chicken Kiev, I remember this one especially.) Yes, these shows are 30+ years old, and some of the foods are not quite what I would serve today (tripe, anyone?) but regardless there is a wealth of information in addition to the entertainment value. Highly recommended

These `The French Chef' DVDs give us 18 episodes of this landmark Julia Child PBS series organized by course rather than by chronology. Among the first disc's side dishes are early (1960s) black and white episodes mixed in with later (1970s) color episodes. These confirm what we have read in Julia Child's biography that the early shows were Herculean feats of improvisation in front of a live TV camera in an improvised Boston (WGBH) studio, where there was no opportunity to edit out mistakes.

These episodes show how Child really set the standard for the TV cooking show and invented almost all the conventions we see nowadays from the likes of Paula Deen, Giada DeLaurentiis, and Emeril Lagasse (in his no-audience `Essence of Emeril' shows). It also shows where show creators such as Alton Brown and Rachael Ray have created great shows primarily by breaking out of Julia Child's prototype.

While the contemporary TV culinarians still follow Julia's lead, it is amazing to see how so many of Julia's shows still do a better job with their subject. For starters, you get the full 30 minutes of material per episode. You don't get 22 minutes of material with three interruptions for commercials and promotions. You also get complete shows on a single dish, albeit relatively complicated dishes like the classic `Salade Nicoise'. After four years of watching the Food Network virtually on a daily basis, I recall no show, even from the more classicly oriented hosts such as Martha Stewart or Ina Garten, dealing with a complete composed salad.

The `Salade Nicoise' is composed of at least three major and two or three minor tasks. Making the potato salad alone takes practically half the show. And, actually seeing how Miss Julia composes the final presentation is easily worth anything from Ina or Martha.

In contrast, the modern 22 minute culinary shows are often used to demonstrate three or even four different dishes, which leaves very little room for expounding on less common techniques. If nothing else, the art of the swapout has been mastered to the point where one may be surprised to see any real cookng at all. This is one reason why I respect Rachael Ray's demonstrations, as she is clearly always working in real time.

One possible negative aspect of this show is seen on some episodes where Miss Julia gives us the traditional French method which has really been discarded by almost all modern chefs. One example which comes to mind is on her demonstration of trussing a roasting chicken. Every modern American writer I have seen, including even James Beard from 30 years ago, does not bother trussing a chicken in any way. They simply tuck the wing tips under the body and may suggest tenting the breast with aluminum foil or draping it with bacon so it does not become too well done while the slower cooking dark meat finishes.

Even this show, however, has its virtues, as when Julia shows us how to detect when a bird has gone past its prime by checking the bone on the tip of the breast. If it is fully bony, the bird is probably well over a year old. If it is still soft, the bird is still between 9 and 12 months old. I was also pleased to see, on this episode, exactly how the wishbone is extracted and was reassured to see that even so expert a cook as Ms. Julia Child had some difficulty in doing it neatly.

In short, Julia Child had no inhibitions against doing messy kitchen tasks.

If you are a Food Network junkie, or just a foodie, you can't go wrong by acquiring these Disks.

Alright, I admit it: I am a chef wannabe. So my reviews of cooking and baking books, DVDs, etc are slanted.

But you will have to admit, that before there was Paul, Jacque, Martha, Mario, Michael, Giada, Bobby and all the other greats, there was, and always will be, the one and only Julia. No one greater. This first DVD from her groundbreaking cooking series is a pure joy. 

When this series first came out in the 60's, I was a little kid. It was on Saturdays on our local PBS station. I would stop anything I was doing and plop myself in front of the TV and wait for this tall, somewhat accented, unusual lady to teach me another cooking/baking secret of French cooking. I was hooked from the moment that I saw her first show. She IS the queen.

This show was the beginning of what would slowly evolve into an incredible food industry, eventually making TV cooking and baking a huge market, and starting the careers of many a chef.

This is a 3-disc set. It comes encased within a jacket that shows many photographs of how the show was really made with set people put into uncomfortable positions in order to invisibly help Ms. Child in making her show the success that it was.

The first disc is entitled "Starters and Side Dishes":
     1. The Potato Show
     2. Your Own French Onion Soup
     3. Bouillabaisse a la Marseillaise
     4. The Spinach Twins
     5. Salade Nicoise
     6. French Fries

The second disc is entitled "Main Courses":
     1. Beef Bourguignon
     2. To Roast a Chicken
     3. The Lobster Show
     4. To Stuff a Sausage
     5. Tripes a la Mode
     6. The Whole Fish Story

The third disc is entitled "Baking, Desserts, and Other Classics":
     1. Queen of Sheba Cake
     2. Cheese and Wine Party
     3. Apple Dessert
     4. Mousse Au Chocolat
     5. The Good Loaf
     6. The Omelette Show

She makes cooking and baking a class in which she does not act as if she is perfect. Things happen and perhaps it won't go as smoothly as it should, but if it can happen to her, then you know it is OK to have mishaps occur for you. She made you comfortable in learning and appreciating a different cuisine. Her point was that she loved French cooking and she wanted to share that knowledge with you. Julia was quite an interesting woman who had a rather interesting and privileged upbringing. Suffice it to say that early in her life, she did not even know how to boil water, much less attempt French cooking. But the love of a man named Paul Child, changed everything and that love evolved her life into the woman we came to know and admire. If you are interested in her biography, I suggest "Appetite for Life: The Biography of Julia Child" by Noel Riley Fitch.

She was such a gracious woman, but all who have known her have said that she was an everyday person, who took no pains in letting you know that she was as comfortable in simple surroundings as in fancy ones. You feel that in her manner of talking in this, or any of her series. She was the "grand dame" of the culinary world and we were blessed by her style and presence

Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys, Stepmom
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
Dysfunctional, Open-Minded, and down right humorous describes "Confessions of an American Girl". Jena Malone (Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys, Stepmom) shines in this film, just like she always does. Two things that will always go together are Jena Malone &amp; an Indie/Black Comedy. But I'll have to admit some of the best acting in this film was that of Brad Renfro (The Client). He plays a 'closet' homosexual, and the obvious reason he hides it is because of his "tough as nails" prison father. 

A lot of the characters in this film are like a lot of people you know &amp; see in real life. And thought most label them as poor, white trash...You discover in "COAG" that they have passionate souls too.

Also, on another note..Clifton Collins, Jr. was one of the best things in this film, and one of the funniest too. So, buy it, rent it..do what you must. It's great

Jena Malone
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
Highly Recommended as an Example of How to Stage and Sequence a Complex Scene.

If you like black comedy, you should enjoy "Confessions of an American Girl". Rena (Jena Malone) is the embodiment of that old cartoon where the guy is sitting on the ground with a noose around his neck and a broken rope in his hand; captioned "some people can't do anything right". Rena lives in a mobile home with her somewhat "strange" family, is suicide challenged, is pregnant by a guy who doesn't want to be seen in public with her, and blames it all on the unfair eight year absence of her loving father, who is in prison for murder. Her dim idealic memories of her father are somewhat biased. 

The highway and its exit ramps are metaphors for her life and her desire to end her life.  The film is not quite as good as "Ghost World" but has much the same tone and feel.

Alicia Witt plays Rena's half-sister. Because Malone and Witt are arguably the most intelligent actresses in Hollywood, you immediately wonder about the wisdom of casting them as moronic trailer trash. But Malone has a special talent for playing this kind of "slack-jawed" character and Witt's standard sarcastic teen character works fine even in this environment. Their scenes together are the best ones in the film; with their reconciliation scene toward the end especially good. 

Brad Renfro does a good job as Rena brother, O-Lon Jones (remember the waitress in Seinfeld's "Bubble Boy" episode) is excellent in a small role and Clifton Collins Jr. is great as Buddy, the prison trustee, who quickly sizes up the situation and sets the forces of change in motion.

While "American Girl" is an above average film, its main scene (the picnic at the prison which actually takes up the majority of the film) pushes it into cinema classic territory. This scene is an example of the way storytelling should be done, and the pacing is absolutely inspired. It is staged perfectly as Buddy orchestrates a sequence of revelations that changes all four visiting family members. Even if you hate the subject of this film it is worth watching just to see how wonderfully they manage this climatic scene. The disasterous visit over, the family leaves the prison with the statement "it went better than it could have".

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

 At first this movie seemed trite, but less than halfway into it, it became something much more. An honest look at a dysfunctional and insecure girl, her older and just downright mean half sister, her brother John, who is the calmest and simplest character ( with a dark secret ) in the movie. Her hardworking single mother ( played superbly by Michelle Forbes ) and her over the top father sent away to prison for two consecutive life terms for murder.
Jena Malone's character dreams of seeing her father, knowing him and making him proud right at the time that she realizes she is pregnant.
In one day at the annual prison picnic ( do these things actually exist? How scary!! ) the family reunites reluctantly except Rena ( Malone ). What follows therafter are numerous amounts of surprises and several laugh out loud moments. While some of this movie may be funny, this is certainly a more serious film that deals with coming of age, the longing that comes with having an absent father in a young persons life, suicide, depression, and coming to terms with one's reality and not just the dream they want. 
I was amazed at how good this movie actually was. The acting by all cast members is really great and the story is not boring, however shocking or disturbing it may be, it is simply real. Possibly someone else's reality which makes it all the more interesting

I'm no big fan of gay or lesbian films. I only bought this DVD bcuz I'm a huge Lili Taylor admirer. So i wasn't expecting very much from it. But while watching this movie I couldn't believe my eyes how great and touching this story was. I especially liked the scene with Lili and Courtney sitting in park, and yearning to touch each other but they couldn't do it and instead they touched themselves in their minds. Another great drama point was Courtneys and Lilis alienation because of Lilis high devotion to her studies. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who loves great Drama. you won't be disappointed.

Not your usual depressing cheesy production value type lezbo vehicle that we're used to seeing, thank god for that.  Pluses:  Courtney is great, the characterization well thought out.  The story is absorbing, well acted, but in the end its just another disappointment, ends left dangling and unresolved, not quite up to the hollywood standard.  Minus:  A downer overall...a little bit homophobic at times, as the womyn in it suffer from their own inner repressions/dialogues, etc.  Still, it's better than most

As a guy, when I see the word "lesbian" on a DVD cover...I spring for it. Usually, (in my experience) it's a pretty stupid movie. "Julie Johnson" is done in a more mature and sophisticated way than the other ones I've seen, but there's still a lot missing here. Julie Johnson is played by Lili Taylor, who has lost her looks quite a bit since I saw her in John Waters' "Pecker." Julie is a typical housewife. She's a stay-at-home-mom (one of her children is Mischa Barton, formerly of "The O.C."), with no High School diploma and a mean husband (Noah Emmerich) who frequently downsizes her. When she decides she's going to get her GED and, possibly, go to college her husband finally pushes her too far and she kicks him out of the house. Her friend, Claire (Courtney Love, in a marvelously subdued performance), is inspired by Julie's decision and leaves her husband. Julie allows Claire to stay with her and the kids and eventually admits to Claire that she has sexual feelings for her. Claire is mad, at first, but eventually admits to the same feelings. Pretty soon, the neighborhood catches on and the couple become outcasts; The film eventually ends abruptly, almost as if one of the lead actors died before they could finish filming. The movie is pretty cliched, you can see what decision the character is going to make about five minutes before they actually do. Taylor plays the role very realistically and Love delivers one of her best performances. This didn't affect my enjoyment (or lack) of the film, but I'm merely saying this as a warning to other viewers. THIS FILM CONTAINS ABSOLUTELY NO NUDITY. The movie has a kind of organic feel to it and the cinematography is less-than-spectacular. It's better than a film like "Better Than Chocolate" but if you never see this film in your lifetime...It's not going to affect anything.

GRADE: B

If you are in the market for a romantic lesbian love story -this is not the movie to look to.  The movie is 1 hour and 34 minutes long and I couldn't wait for it to be over!  I love Lilly Taylor -she was amazing in Mystic Pizza, Who Shot Andy Warhol, Dog Fight, and most recently made a special run during the last days of Six Feet Under.  As a Lilly Taylor fan you will be sorely disappointed that she chose this role.  This story is about a woman who wants more out of life, but the script is so far fetched in how this transition unfolds.  She goes from minimal, menial high school drop out to physicist student extraordinaire in what seems like the span of a semester or two.  Granted, the time table could have been better in this film, but that's only a very small part of it.  Every single character in this movie is obnoxious and hard to like with the exception of Taylor.  Her husband starts off a sexist, chauvinist and ends the film in much the same way you would just like buy him a clue.  Her children are bratty and always shouting they can't leave the room or scene quick enough.  Her love interest is Courtney Love, and while I love her too -even of late with all of her bad press she's not likeable either.  Courtney Love is probably the worst of them all.  Her character is afraid of change, afraid of being true to herself, worries too much about what other people think of her, wants to be accepted at the cost of herself, and as a result runs back to what is familiar to her and in the end it's okay with her.  The only redeeming quality in the movie Julie Johnson is that Julie Johnson did not want to go back to the kind of woman she was before her awakening.  She never lost her girlish vulnerability throughout the movie, and although cautiously and at times timidly eventually embraced the changes of her new life with admirable, quiet strength.

****
I really enjoyed this movie for a variety of reasons.  It was entertaining and fun, and the subject matter was also interesting to me, since I love both personal growth and intellectual learning.  The plot of "Julie Johnson" centers around two women who leave difficult marriages, move in together, develop romantic feelings for each other, and around the effects of their decisions upon each other, their friends, and their children.  Julie returns to school and discovers many things about herself that she missed out on since she had not ever graduated from high school and had always thought of herself as stupid, an opinion reinforced regularly by her brutish husband.  

I was unsure if I would enjoy this movie, as I do not necessarily enjoy lesbian love stories, finding them generally caught up in the message of the acceptance of homosexuality more than a great plot, acting, directing, etc.  

This movie is not like that; it is more about the awakening of a woman's potential at mid-age.  It is about how when we grow personally, we can leave people behind, even people we dearly love.  It is about the lines drawn between friendship and romantic love---how do we draw them and when?  It is about how we decide to call the end to a romantic relationship.  When we are adults and change dramatically, discovering something new about ourselves that revolutionizes our lives, how does this affect those around us?  In this movie, for the main character Julie, it was not lesbianism that she discovered that mainly transformed her life, but a love for learning.   When you are an adult and a life-long learner how do you cope in our society, which oftentimes tells you that this is "weird" behavior?  (This last question is my favorite of all, and I related to this movie a lot, as often people who love to learn, study, and discuss ideas (like me) find themselves the targets of prejudice as being dull, boring, and "no fun".) All of these questions are explored in this story of two blue-collar lower middle-class homemakers and the challenges they face.  

The lesbian lovemaking scenes are not explicit, they are in good taste, and they made sense within the context of the movie.

The actors in this movie are fabulous---Lili Taylor, Courtney Love, and the actors playing the children as well.

I did not think the movie was clich�d at all.  The husbands were stereotyped and seemed in many ways like Neanderthals...but there were also men portrayed in positive ways, such as Julie's major professor.  This is not an anti-male film.

Lovely, quality, unforgettable film.

Wow - what an excellent film!  Great acting, directing and story.  Sort of "Rainman meets Hoboken housewife meets lesbian love affair".  I must admit, I was very leery of watching this, fearing it was going to be a Lesbian Love Story.  I must admit, I am not a fan of the L-Word, bit I loved Queer As Folk.  

I watched this because I had a copy of the movie, having done a DVD Release Party at the club I work at.  Otherwise, it would have been very unlikely that I would have ever watched it.  That said, I am very glad I did.

The 90 minute film packs a lot of punch, and the first 30 minutes zoom by, setting the storyline for the rest of the film, so watch carefully.  Lili Taylor and Courtney Love, the leading ladies are both excellent in their roles as relatively unhappy Hoboken NJ housewives.  Julie (played by Taylor) embarks on a mission to get her GED, against her husbands wishes.  She eventually kicks him out.

Claire (played by Love), her best friend from High School, leaves her husband.  With no place to go, Claire moves in with Julie and her 2 children.  In the meantime, Julie begins her quest for knowledge, passing her GED and eventually turning her goals towards a college degree.

Notice, we still don't have much of a love story, do we?  Midway through the film, that all changes - in a compassionate, yet confusing manner.  Without giving away the entire story line (which includes a few very funny scenes amongst most of the drama), two women must come to terms with their feelings, for each other, and for themselves.

This is really a gem of a film, and (as I have said before), it is a shame this will not be seen by many --- some whom desperately need to see a story like this.  If Brokeback Mountain and Transamerica can make the big screen, well then so should Julie Johnson.  This is not a lesbian love story, this IS a story about relationships, and the journey most of us take to achieve happiness and love in our own lives. 

Buy, rent or see Julie Johnson

How do you twist and turn the most obnoxious individual with  a completely disgusting job into a hero? That is black magic. After some time you begin to wish him well and feel tempted to light up.
This lovely satire on political correctness, lobbyism, and corruption draws you into the unbearable lightness of smooth talking. If you argue correctly, you can not be wrong, right?
Eckhart is perfect in the main part; there are many nice smaller parts, but my favorite is the little boy playing the hero's son. The boy deserves a nomination for best supporting actor. Actually he looks like Scarlet's little brother sometimes. Are they related

I tend to be hard on a lot of major motion pictures because, to be frank, they mostly suck. However, this only turned into a "major motion picture" after Fox Searchlight bought it after it's screening at the Sundance Film Festival. Before that it was the vision of fledgling director Jason Reitman to independently bring Christopher Buckley's tremendously smart and funny book of the same name to the screen... and he does a good job. There's a reason why this film is loaded with the (mostly unpaid or underpaid) who's who of Hollywood talent. The script and screenplay are that good. This is not the typical low-brow, fart-joke riden crap you're used to seeing out of Hollywood. There are good acting performances throughout as well. If you are a person of above average wit and have a dry sense of humor, you'll like it.

It starts out well but half-way through, it loses its direction and suffers an identity crisis. Avoidable

Jason Reitman makes an impressive debut as director with this entertaining comedy `Thank You For Smoking,' which is more satirical than any of the comedies his father Ivan Reitman made. Despite the film's plot about one Nick Naylor, ace spokesperson for the tobacco industry, `Thank You For Smoking' refuses to take sides while keeping us hugely entertained with its dialogues.

Aaron Eckhart delivers a superb performance as Nick Naylor, a chief spokesman and lobbyist for tobacco industry, who in his `spin' mode can easily manipulate the opinions of the suspicious audiences on TV show. Nick is also a good father to his son Joey (Cameron Bright), before whom Nick tries to be a role model. Today Nick thinks of a brilliant idea of production placement - how about showing Hollywood stars smoking in a spaceship? - he flies to California with his son, meets a suave movie producer wearing kimono (Rob Lowe), and in his free time delivers a package to an ailing old man (Sam Elliott) who is about to sue the tobacco company.

The satire is funny, but its target changes frequently. It could be tobacco industry (why not), but also could be those politicians (represented by William H. Macy's senator) who seems very hostile to Nick, and Nick himself. Sometimes the story goes too far, which includes a brief episode of abduction, but it is most effective when it shows Nick's darkly funny conversations with his friends, lobbyists for alcohol and guns (Mari Bello and David Koechner, calling themselves MOD Squad) over their lunch.

Other cast includes Robert Duvall, Adam Brody, Kim Dickens, J. K. Simmons, and Katie Holmes. The acting is unanimously good, but the film belongs to Eckhart's Nick Naylor, or his art of spin.

The film may lack the thought-provoking ideas about the on-going social issues. Still what you see in `Thank You For Smoking' is always amusing, clever, and even absurdly funny, and is never boring

Thank You For Not Smoking is one damn sharp movie!  This movie ends before it starts, its one of those where you want to rewind it in the middle of watching just to make sure that you didn't miss any thing.  Yes, it's just that blunt.  If Aaron Eckard who plays big tobacco lobbyist does not condition you to think differently about smoking or some thing other conversational topic then maybe you need to watch this movie again.  The body of the message of this film portrays is not that you should pick up smoking, that is it right and that you should go out and buy your child a pack on their 18th birthday.  But rather this movie's real message is about challenging the viewer to think for himself or herself.  Amen!  A film that makes people to think for themselves in the world of movies where you walkout dumber than you go in and then you wonder, why did I just pay for that?  

Naylor's job is to get himself caught in the middle of the controversy of smoking in America.  His message is that people should think for themselves and that big tobacco needs customers, so it to their benefit of people who have cancer to continue to smoke and if they die it would be a loss for the smoking industry.  Naylor's personal and professional life are one in the same, as he is convinced himself that when you on the right side of the argument you can never be wrong.  And even if you have to change your argument half way through it you can always be right, even when right is all negotiable. 

For all the films produced today that believe their causes are to inform and pump information into your head, fact or fiction, Thank You For Not Smoking ask you the question of whether or not thinking that way is correct, and if so, why?  It moves very fast and will not be film that you decide to turn off half way through, includes many bonus features and gives you a real life view of how this movie was produced and what was the inspiration of making such a movie.

There's not a lot you need to know about THANK YOU FOR SMOKING, except that it's a gleefully jaundiced, well-nigh perfectly paced adaptation of Christopher Buckley's novel. As a teacher who used to lead a class on Critical Thinking, I took particular pleasure in the witty "spins" glib lobbyist Nick Naylor treats us to as he advocates for Big Tobacco.

SIDELIGHT: Not one person in this film actually smokes a cigarette. And special shout-outs to excellent supporting actors David Koechner (as gun advocate Bobby Jay Bliss) and J.K. Simmons (as Budd "B.R." Rohrabacher). Oh, and Rob Lowe is actually darned funny in his role. I guess he can act after all
